'sorry everyone    i know this is supposed to be an  art  film   but wow  they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch  although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent  this story is too painful to watch  the absence of a sound track was brutal  the loooonnnnng shots were too long  how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking  especially when the dialogue is two people complaining  i really had a hard time just getting through this film  the performances were excellent  but how much of that dark  sombre  uninspired  stuff can you take  the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene  otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman  and i m no fan f his either  i think anyone who says they enjoyed       hours of this is   well  lying',-1

'when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors  it was one of many movies i watched with my parents  but this was the only one we walked out of  since then i had never seen interiors until just recently  and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it  what a pretentious  ponderous  and painfully boring piece of    s wine and cheese tripe  woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career  in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman  allen gives us a dark  angular  muted  insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce  estrangement  career  love  non love  halitosis  whatever  the film  intentionally  has no comic relief  no music  and is drenched in shadowy pathos  this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature  using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a  more pronounced depth of meaning and truth   but woody allen is no ingmar bergman  the film is painfully slow and dull  but beyond that  i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters  instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling  whining  nicotine stained  martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity  amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room  everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes  everyone is  lost  and  struggling   desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them  it s never about resolution  it s only about interminable introspective babble  it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience s ability to connect  woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out  and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining  i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance  i highly recommend this one if you re feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death  otherwise  let s just pretend this film never happened',-1

'this film is mediocre at best  angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers  her bitchy demeanor from  law and order  carries over in a failed attempt at comedy  charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti comedy  the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise s marriage  hopefully that effort produces better results',-1

'the film is bad  there is no other way to say it  the story is weak and outdated  especially for this country  i don t think most people know what a  walker  is or will really care  i felt as if i was watching a movie from the    s  the subject was just not believable for the year       even being set in dc  i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end  most didn t stay for the q a  either i don t think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time  many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn t know how to finish them  he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on  i really didn t get woody s  carter  private life or boyfriend either  what were all the  artistic  male bondage and torture pictures  from iraq prisons  about  what was he thinking  i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody s character  car   it didn t work  it didn t even seem to make sense really the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson  he played his character  car  flawlessly  you really did get a great sense of what a  walker  may have been like  say twenty years ago   he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it as for lauren  lily and kristin    boring don t see it  it is painful  unless you are a true harrelson fan',-1

'this film is one giant pant load  paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay  and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process the worst though is woody harrelson  whom i ordinarily like when he s properly cast  he plays  the walker   a homosexual man in d c  who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite  he couldn t have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick  his  southern accent  is that  off the rack  version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers  as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has  it is monotonous  but  his is not the worst accent in the movie  his  boyfriend   played by moritz bleibtreau  attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him  he is incapable of rolling his r s in spite of the fact that in real life he is german  and speaks several languages   one of them being italian  that s kind of a good reason to cast someone else don t ya think from the story  to the screenplay  to the directing  to the camera work  to the performances by the leads  this movie is bad from beginning to end  the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses  lily tomlin  lauren bacall  and kristin scott thomas  only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact  in fact  all three are excellent  in spite of being trapped in a really bad film  ufortunately  no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws  if you like these three actresses  watch them in something else  this movie is not worth your time',-1

'this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years  not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not  nothing is of any interest  the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful   i just sat in utter amazement during this movie  thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertainingthe producers of this movie were very clever  they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast  people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think  woody harrison  kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie  boy are they in for a horrible time if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie  some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning',-1

'a worn out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case   the equally worn out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out with such an outstanding case  one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins  but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity  no character arcs  and inexplicable behavior the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary    or on the other hand  completely unexplored  it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers  when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture a regrettably dreadful movie  when will lauren bacall pick a good one  i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas  this one is definitely one to miss',-1

'i saw this movie at a drive in in       until  howard the duck  i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen  this movie tried to combine all the genera in one  comedy  horror  teenage angst  and the hot rod that must have sired  my mother  the car   maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it s time',-1

'ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical      s teens in turmoil movie  it is not a horror or science fiction movie  plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their  hot rod  club because they cannot meet the rent  once kicked out  they decide to try an old haunted house  the only saving grace for the film is that the  ghost   paul blaisdell in the she creature suit  turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell',-1

'the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya  there is no story  no humor  no nothing  the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs up advertisements stitched together  heavily influenced from the matrix and kung fu hustle but very poorly executed i did not go a lot of expectations  but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder  what were these guys thinking      the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini the reason why i did not give a rating of     is that every time i think i have seen the worst  bollywood proves me wrong',-1

'shame on yash raj films and aditya chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth you tube standards  i was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction  plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene i just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can  throw away  crores on such stupidity  shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to  saif ali khan  completely disappointed in your choice of film  kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and akshay comes up as the dim wit  anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for english  his cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last    minutes  it was enough to pop a blood vessel  don t waste any brain cells  energy or your money to go see this  go see   rent amu  with konkana sensharma instead  a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of india intelligent  poignant and a wonderful story tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in indian cinema making',-1

'if this is a      product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry  yash raj  then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil  akshay  saif and kareena  then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film  the film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and akshay kumar  he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film  that itself was a clear indicator of the director s vision  every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted  anil kapoor s gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times  and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie in short it s the biggest waste of resourses after  jhoom barabar jhoom   i would say that even  aaja nachle  was a better enjoyable movie than this one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved  the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshay s love story  after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music  vishal shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song  the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically  only one song  falak tak chal  is somehow good of all in the lot  an opportunity wasted by vishal shekhar regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this   akshay and saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign location  probably ladakh   in the next scene they are searching for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hills with kareena in the dicky of their car  i am still thinking who wrote this if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts  you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god  are we still seeing a      movie with all these technical heights achieved  so no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan dear anil kapoor   akshay kumar  if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out  as artists of such stature  you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers  people still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively  i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie  the actors and the production house both',-1

'i had some expectation for the movie  since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif  well  i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom    but if dhoom   is compared to tashan  i would say dhoom   is very realistic when i saw the credits at the beginning  i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way  well  the very first scene itself pis ed me off  then  the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences  me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights  it was like akshay against some    thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns  phew   you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story  it reminded me of some of the early    s movies well  the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena  who looked really hot in this one and for that  i give a rating of   out of    guys  please  please   don t see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie  well  you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes thats all',-1

'the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar  akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in      neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman  it is hilarious  except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film  the story looks like the writer told his   yr old son to write  the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director  except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan  i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody       is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero',-1

'i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj film jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss  lakhan singh  english  the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she can t do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh  who is also known as bhaiyyaji  but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji   lakhan singh is a don  in the meantime  bhaiyyaji hires a man  bachchan pandey  to track down jimmy and pooja starring saif ali khan  kareena kapoor  anil kapoor and akshaye kumar  the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra  tashan  has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched  yes  the scenery is good and kareena kapoor  and her much publicised weight loss  looks good  but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other   hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production  with reference to songs  unfortunately  there is not one song that i can remember now there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well  but this cannot be said for anil kapoor   it did not suit him at all as a villain  lastly never mind aditya chopra  who in the past has produced and directed good films such as  mohabbatein   what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie conclusion  bad movie  not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression',-1

'i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted  so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that  it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom       and saif ali khan s son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback  after watching it  i understood that why their wasn t a proper trailer because there wasn t anything in the film to show  the story was extremely dum and even a    year old child can come up with a better story line  there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it s difficult to figure out that who is killing who  also the action was daft   unrealistic e g    man with a handgun managed to kill about     men with machine guns while i was watching tashan it reminded me of   films sin city  during the opening credits koyla  anil kapoor s terrible english like amrish puri in koyla jhoom barabar jhoom  the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny i also heard the budget is    crores which is the same amount as dhoom   and i don t know where all the money went to  anyway if you did not like dhoom   then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan  race was hot on heels and that is a million times better the only   good songs are dil haara   challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film  even anil kapoor s terrible english couldn t save this discomfiture',-1

'tashan   the title itself explains the nature of the movie this type of movies are actually made for flop  what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c grade movies  or even some c grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan  the much hyped and over confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box office which it certainly deserved in my view  this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films  banner  how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick  he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi s ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last  the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences  hearts  in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions  i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay  but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif  s hand instead of akshay  just from the starting point i expected of it  but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth  saif is the main behind the whole adventure  while akshay joins in the midst  in any movie  the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit  and tashan loses in this way  and unexpectedly failed to become a hit akshay s has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies  he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again  in between saif did a great job in race  and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie  but he has fully developed himself in the acting field  and last but not the least about kareena  she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean  but i myself don t think so  instead she became slim  yes slim    it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people  or say  male   beside them it is nice that saif s son ibrahim appears in the beginning   last as young saif  i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood  or say want to be admitted in an asylum  thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films  in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of   years before going into practical directions sorry  i don t like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies',-1

'i just saw the movie in theater  the movie has very few good points to talk about  kareena s beauty and a couple of songs may be  thats it  the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas  anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed  even mumbai indians too  just now chennai has made it to semi final  but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes  now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood  but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real  but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time  they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie  now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people  but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work  all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded  at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar  this is height of stupidity  audience is not paying to watch such stupidity  i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies  they cant make it  the last good action i have seen was from  ghatak  and  khiladiyon ka khialdi   the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me  does these people see their movie after completion  can t they figure out that the slow motion action  which is done using ropes  is too unrealistic and childish  better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it  i just want to go back to amitabh s era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes  the sound effect was not very effective in those days  but visually it is much better than current era scenes this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors  please don t make any more action movies  until you acquire the art of making it realistic',-1

'i was very displeased with this move  everything was terrible from the start  the comedy was unhumorous  the action overdone  the songs unmelodious  even the storyline was weightless  from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom  i had high expectations  the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all  of course  kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds  i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done  they tend to exaggerate way too much  in chinese films  this style works because that is their signature piece  but  hindi cinema s signature are the songs  a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic  but  in the future  i m sure these action movies will get much sharper  also to be noted  comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly  good luck next time',-1

'if there is one film which is the worst of this year  it s tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom   style film  and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock  it was even worst then dhoom   and what i expected first saif s introduction which is boring then saif  kareena meet  kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god  what he is doing in such a weird film  what kinda role it is  what acting is he doing  his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes  but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance  overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another jokevijay krishna acharya would have got   films more to direct  if this film had worked  thats the strategy of yashraj  only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music  vishal shekhar  is ordinaryperformances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air  he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating  kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay',-1

'absolutely awful movie  utter waste of time background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech  well if you really listen closely  whatever they speak is actually unintelligible camera work is bad  editing is not present  background score gives a headache  action is shoddy  dialogs are unintelligible  acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler  now she looks like a starved wrestler  hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it  but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure please if you want to torture yourself  go ahead watch this',-1

'sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie    i had had a trauma after watching welcome        and thought that they wont do it again  but after loads of amazing promos  tashan finally ended as heart attack such amazing   songs in promo   dil haara  chhaliya and tashan mein      and what u get in the movie  zero story  predictable plot  plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss      music wise another major disaster    in the music album  they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these   jokers and they haven t thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts     that song is such nice  quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album        if you plan to watch this movie  i would say  watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like     bachchan bachchan pandey    overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english go away man  i need to puke',-1

'i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent  the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest saif has over acted  kareena has improved her figure  but is not a good actress anyway  akshay is good  anil is also good  may i say the role wasn t good  great deal of cheapness is filled in  wondered if that was supposed to be the  comedy part  of the movie  just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish  it has a history of so many good films overall  i was totally disappointed with the movie',-1

'this movie is horrible  the acting is a waste basket  no crying  no action  hopeless songs  though the scenery is great  i have always wanted to go to greece anyway  as for saif  you d expect a great performance  but even he let down the people akshay kumar  recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs  he was sensational in this movie  for only this performance  filmfare should introduce another award  the toiletries award for the worst performance  by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat kareena kapoor  she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma  in acting  in looks  or in body  she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her  she comes into this movie wearing bikini s and tank tops and short shorts  i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife to be dress like that  but  she must ve impressed some people dressing like that  and if you ask how  then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie  they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom  including me  personally i think that she dressed like a whore  but i really liked it i am forced to give it a       but i d really give this movie a       an unachieved film',-1

'for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c  p must now be compared first off  the beginning did have elements of style    and if handled well  could have become a cult classic  a la pulp fiction or a desi desperado   but the plot  was there one   begins to meander and at one point completely loses it throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english  a call center smart alec  a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb  a levitating  gravity defying hit man and a cop with a hundred  or was it a thousand  black cat commandos on their trail    good ingredients in competent hands  but this is where i would like to ask the director  sir  what were you smoking im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making   for what must never be done   insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music   watch the videos   hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed  vishal  shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy    as i sign off  i want to really  badly know how does akshay s bullet wound vanish in a microsecond   what were you editors doing  tashan  maybe',-1

'the sight of kareena kapoor in a two piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan  the mega disappointing  mind numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend  bad films are bad films and we see some every week  but tashan is not just a bad film  it s a terrible film  terrible because it takes its audience for granted  terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they ve got big movie stars onboard written and directed by vijay krishna acharya  tashan is what you d describe as a road movie  but one that s going in all the wrong directions  saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff  a call centre executive who s hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji   that s anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster  desperate to go cool  jimmy s got his eye on pooja  the gangster s pretty young assistant  played by kareena kapoor   who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of    crore rupees  determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja  bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job  so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey  the gangster s faithful aide from kanpur  who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that s hidden across the length and breadth of the country much like those bad eighties potboilers  tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot  but the treatment s so over the top  so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect  instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three act structure  you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed  that garish item song in the desert  the bullet dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort  kareeena s bikini moment  even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks  a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala  and believe it or not  even a dhanno style horse driven tonga  in all fairness  not all these set pieces are badly done   the item song in the desert is quite neat actually   but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture  because you re just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really  little do you expect in a seemingly fast paced road movie  to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making  what s more  i don t think they cared either   the film reeks of arrogance  arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work  tashan is like an overcooked stew there are films that kill you softly  and then there s tashan  a film that kills you with excess  packaged snazzily with glossy finish camera work  exotic locations and fancy costumes  every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together  but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn t hold  borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesn t help either because they don t blend with the film s wafer thin plot  one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging  but anil kapoor s grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists  and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly  unable to find his feet  kareena kapoor  meanwhile  queen of over the top delivery  does a decent job  but of course  if tashan is salvaged to some extent  it s thanks to akshay kumar s irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character  you cringe when he s cupping his crotch repeatedly  and you scowl when he delivers those double meaning dialogues  but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he s up there despite some good music from vishal shekhar  the songs seem like they re only prolonging your misery  well that s because tashan is a test of your patience  in case you didn t know  tashan means style  i m sorry to say  this film has none',-1

'such a long awaited movie   but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day   from the trailers it looked like a action movie  but it turned out to be a out   out comedy a bad comedy   but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors  they ve done their part of the movie very well  good acting  but i don t think that can save the movie   india has been shot beautifully  kerala  rajasthan   ladakh   were all saturated with color  alright  nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there    action sequences were shot very shabbily  no one could make out head   tail of the stunts  they ve used akki akshay kumar  very well but could ve been done much much better  animation is the worst i ve seen in recent movies    s movies had better animation scenes i guess initial scene where the car is falling off  flying should be better word  the road into lake  and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every    to    mins  just to make sure audiences don t forget the movie name i guess',-1

'this is the biggest flop of       i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster  the songs have been added without situations  the story have been stretched to fill the   hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it s like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with     people  only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish    akki is also done a good job     but the movieee just forget it',-1

'i wasn t terribly impressed with dante s  st season offering in  homecoming   it wasn t much of a horror story  but rather a smart political statement with the undead  screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men s sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women  the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists  then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home  i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak  but is unclear because this is never revisited  the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah it seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end  the worst episode  well  except for chocolate',-1

'i ve now written reviews for several of the moh episodes  and this is among the worst  an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll  if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you   let s check out the basement     then this is your show  except  it s not amusing or entertaining   it s just annoying the extent of the virus is never  ever showed  i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only  as the resulting situation is very  very frightening  but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home  and ultimately dies at his hands  the woman flees north  and runs into a few tens situations  then  some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her  things that make you go huh    or something  then  she is huddling for warmth  the end awful  these directors are mailing this tripe in',-1

'a huge disappointment from writer hamm and director dante  their previous collaboration on the first season s  homecoming  was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways  this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered  the supposed  payoff  showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing  if the point of the story was an extraterrestrial  cleaning  of the planet of it s human infestation  why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion  why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la stephen king s  the stand  instead of having the male population butcher the females  i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous  the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it  i like a lot of both dante and hamm s work but this was just unwatchable',-1

'i m not alone in admiring the first superman movie  a film that richard donner executed masterfully  i am also not alone in scorning richard lester s superman      which brings us to the richard donner cut of the same movie  sadly it is still an absolute abomination superman s world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses  but superman   stretches things too far  it doesn t matter who directed superman   because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader  in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do  unlike the original superman  with or without his powers  superman s strength  or lack thereof  is handled in the least believable manner  there is too much to criticize  so i will not bother  i condemn this movie    perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on  super duper bad',-1

'so   we get so see added footage of brando   interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff  susannah york was hardly a slouch  new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn t notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets  real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that   let s listen to donner make fun of lester s version that made more logical sense  the president talks of the zod  defacing  the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore  tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd  superman s  freedom of the press  line sounded silly compared to    care to step outside  which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark s earlier scene in the truck stop  then there is the ending with the  turn back the world to go back in time  effect  it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack  n j  ever went since it doesn t free zod and company any more',-1

'superman ii   the richard donner cut should be a fan s dream come true  at long last  footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life  a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored  it seems like a winning situation  and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this  esoteric dream  is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence  while it s entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project  and it is only a very few times you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics  but then we start seeing new footage  alternates from superman   the movie for the trial  and that first bit of hesitation fades away  hey  this is pretty neat  things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project  and it doesn t convince at all  and from this point on  it never ever lets up  it s probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects  but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was  you ll believe a man can fly  it s difficult to believe anything shown on screen here  the best effects in this are from the original productions another issue with this re cut  a lot of it just doesn t make sense  the only reason any of it really works is because we ve all seen the theatrical version of superman ii  a movie that does make sense  lester s superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly  part of this could be because donner didn t get to complete shooting  the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible  what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent after viewing this  one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material  michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester  the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii  that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence  not ironically  both were filmed by donner  but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re edited in such a hasty fashion  that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing  while lester honored the donner material  lester here is thrown under the bus so is there anything good in this release  well marlon brando is in it  and that s neat to see  in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman   the movie  but that only highlights the problems of this release  any of the major scenes  really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando  would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section  instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances  many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used  sloppy edits and bad decisions watch the opening scene at the daily planet  why are we looking at jackie cooper s back as he calls for lois and clark  at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on  i was initially confused by this  because i expected to see lois  the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this battle scenes are a mess too  with no geography between cuts  it s just random action  of course  the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates  they should have used more of lester s footage  but probably had too much pride to admit that the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well  as noted elsewhere  the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation  xk     while we all know it s the  xk       a blind man in stm knows that  the producers of this assembly  who tried so hard to honor the original film  dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production  for all the supposed care that was put into this  the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner s didn t make this a separate release here in the states  as it is  we re expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a  play all  option  it s really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes  but after that initial viewing  i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else  i know after my experience of watching this  i had new respect for lester s version  it s by no means perfect  but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief  he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so  while this new re cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history',-1

'i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was  was the viewer supposed to learn something  or reflect on anything here  what was up with the pumpkins  was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots  does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel  why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews  it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery   the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished i am truly amazed  i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community',-1

'this is an awful film  yea the girls are pretty but its not very good  the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn t get in the way  well  okay it might be interesting  but its not  because its so badly paced and and only partly acted  i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen  probably more laughable then they do on tv   i won t even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest  never read about that in the old west  this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward i like schlock films but this is ridiculous  there is a reason that i don t go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good  the plot taking a back seat to breasts  the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats  the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent  the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level  infantile but harmlessly fun  something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie the ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film i need not watch this again of interest to probably no one  the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil  a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives',-1

'i saw this film at its premier at sundance    since american beauty is a movie that had something to say  i had hopes for towelhead  unfortunately  it was a disappointment  in fact  of countless movies i ve seen in almost a dozen sundance festivals  towelhead is the only sundance movie i ve ever wanted to walk out early from the worst problem with towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of  provocative  concepts concerning cultural stereotypes  rather than with an organic human drama  the screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by alicia erian  the famous edith wharton quote comes to mind  i have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author s political views  that observation is especially devastating for towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic  if there ever was a time when towelhead s white male villains  condescending portrayals of blacks  ironic treatments of foreign cultures  etc   were fresh  it s long past for a more detailed review  please look up any of the many professional reviews available online  almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on on the other hand  the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled  as you read through the reviews in this and similar sites  you ll frequently come across superlatives   stunning    breathtaking    profound    shocking       it embarrasses me to read them  but it does not surprise me  indeed  i ve encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial  cultural  gender  or sexual issues as deeply moving  thought provoking  full of profound insight  if you are such a person  by all means  rent towelhead and be moved by it  on the other hand  if you set your standards higher  you can safely pass on this one',-1

'when i was     grease   was like crack  it was a classless  shameful  euphoric  and powerfully addictive experience  my sister and i would watch it  rewind it  and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another  so  if you are an    year old girl  and you reviewed this film as  brilliant  or  fun  or  better than the original grease   you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass if  however  you are not a little girl  you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease   was anything but an inane  artless  slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production  distribution  and or consumption for the sake of criticism  i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows   in a well executed musical  the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters  in grease    with a few debatable exceptions  to the music is obscenely pointless  most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way   score tonight    reproduction    do it for our country   and  prowlin    without making one concrete statement about any of the film s characters or themes  plus  all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance    the t birds should be badass  and if not at least somewhat likable  but instead each of them is an annoying wussy dufus loser  in the end  when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred t bird jacket and initiates him into the gang  michael should kick it to the ground  spit on it  and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it  but of course  he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads  there is no greater honor than to be one with the t birds    since michael is beautiful  smart  kind  resourceful  and above average in everyway  his musical impotence notwithstanding   it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask  stephanie  on the other hand  is a slovenly  slack jawed  bubble gum smacking  dirty sweatshirt wearing  gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat  so aside from being pretty  i guess   she harbors no likable characteristics  thus  audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael s attraction to her i could go on and on  but i didn t want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair  i will say this though  to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time s sake  grease   is an experience akin to re living your first kiss  only you are    now and kissing a snot nosed    year old kid with acne and slobby braces  the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed  trust me',-1

'i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial   minutes of the film  i managed to stomach       minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead  which  by the way  is great fun  the story has massive holes in it  the plot line is hugely over stated and dull  the acting is awful  especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at  looking daft and singing like a castrato   morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable  especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet  freeman and timberlake s characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father son relationship of sorts or something  which simply isn t evident at all apart from the fact that  though freeman s character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake  he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line  which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion don t watch this film  it is a pure waste of time',-1

'i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love  it s not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime  everything s pretty restrained and you don t really get an idea of who these characters are so  as a viewer  i wasn t able to become emotionally invested in the storyline  i guess i m not the target audience for this but i m not sure who is  everything s muted and soft focus and earth tones   nothing s very interesting  i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it s handled so discreetly that i was disappointed  rent personal best instead',-1

'i ve read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained  this movie is nothing  it s so badly written  directed and acted that it barely makes an impression  the characters speak in cliche ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible  while that might make this campy and fun  it doesn t because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull  it s as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn t allowed by studio execs to give the story some true to life gusto or didn t have the cojones  this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard issue bad lifetime tv movie',-1

'they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love  the only thing worse is the film itself  the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital  at one point when the wife leaves the husband  a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack  no kidding  the actors try but are defeated by the inept  unbelievably terrible script  direction is staggeringly bad  no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation  how do things like this get made  i m turning off the television before it s over',-1

'i remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager  but i wanted to see it again  because traci lords is now earning a living as a  serious actor   what the hell was going on in the eighties  this is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors  definitely a waste of money',-1

'i am an actor producer  director and what i am about to say are facts  this project was the worst film in movie making history  from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke  why would blockbuster released such crap  i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession  was the director trying to make a bad movie  i don t think so  i seen bad zombie movies  but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table  this movie sucks    i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself  but please consider in taking up a different profession  i respect the fact that you completed a movie  but i have to ask you   were you smoking crack    i mean the makeup on your girls  the scary zombies  what were you thinking  to the whole nation  if i could have voted zero i would have  worst film in movie making history',-1

'german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible  he s unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium  this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of ew  i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set  the answer is  subterranean  lommel dug a pit and buried it the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies  only someone who has lived in los angeles  where every auto mechanic  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face the main character  a villainous beat cop  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent  aside from being a serial killer  he is also the oldest beat cop in la  despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody  then drags them into his home  which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse   and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners  the lapd refuses to investigate  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment the sets are excruciatingly bad  the production designer s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint  enough to paint  precinct      on a cardboard wall since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals  a sad assortment of european emigres  possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands   bimbos  mimbos  and desperate middle aged women  and since little if any money was spent on sets  special efx  locations or other production value  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms  sadly  they couldn t afford a police car  the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him  one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies  the other fits right in  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her  don t ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered  just accept lommel s logic and enjoy the absurd ride after much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance  they look exactly as they did before death  maybe even prettier  with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes  looking nothing like zombies  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll  and injects large doses of cheesy euro trash techno into the soundtrack  we re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise  stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty unlike other zombies  lommel s girls speak and function as normal    er  i mean  as they did before becoming zombified  this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog  yes  a golden shower it is i won t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending  all i can say is it s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece  the spirit of ed wood lives on    or should i say his geist',-1

'the plot of  edison  was decent  but one actor in particular ruined the entire film  justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie  he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen  and should face the same fate as the entire f r a t  squad whether it was an emotional scene  an action scene  or even a silent scene  justin timberlake managed to ruin it do not waste your time watching this film  don t even bother downloading it  midget porn would be a much better choice and justin  if you re reading this  stick to music  even though you re no good at that  you ve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing',-1

'this movie is a joke  i mean a  ha ha  funny joke  why  because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh i got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical  inane plot and horrible acting  wow within this movie there are so many unanswered questions    for example  why do these women become zombies and how  why are there four black women who are zombie s  caretakers  and what is their purpose  since when does   people make up a  nation  of zombies  and is smeared black eye mascara  scary  to anyone  anywhere  even a   year old and lastly  why was this movie made at all  why  why  why  no answer  that s what i thought on the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie  we apologize for this movie in advance  lol  at least they had the decency to do this much',-1

'i cannot believe that this movie was ever created  i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse  the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup  the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes  finally  there are maybe five or six zombies total  definitely not a nation  the best part of the movie  if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished  again to reiterate other user comments  the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie  also  there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all  it is never explained',-1

'seriously crappy movie first off  the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse furniture store  the  bad  cop takes a girl  which they had pulled over  into the warehouse s attic  while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there  the  bad  cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag  and the newbie cop doesn t think there are any problems  but he still wonders what was in the bag  so he asks  gets a bullshit response  and then he thinks everything is ok  for now  the  bad  cop repeats this process  and even once with a tit scene  made it slightly better   but eventually people start to catch on  which took awhile considering how f   ing obvious it was  one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies  like ya do  now  the  bad  cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch  and then he gets rid of the duffel bagged body since she had the oogey boogey magic put on her  she comes back with lots of eye shadow on  which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie    also  the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become  eye shadow monsters   some of the girls meet up with a dude  who is apparently a currency specialist  and he offers them a ride  they look normal to him apparently   but when the girls see other people  such as the one girls husband  he freaks out because she is hideous  some people freak out  but others don t even notice      massive plot hole so  to wrap it up  the eye shadow monsters kill the  bad  cop  who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene  it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel  like anyone would want to see part   of this cow dropping',-1

'i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie  it was so bad  i was totally fooled by the box art  don t be fooled   its not worth your time i promise you  i don t know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what  i am so disappointed    the description on the back of the box doesn t even match  the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper  the synopsis on the back says she is only     did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it   those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be  if anyone actually liked this flick then i ve lost all faith in humanity and don t even get me started on the story compared to the title  or the fact that the entire movie was done all in   locations  or that the cops didn t even have close to real uniforms  why would i even say that   who cares about the cops uniforms   compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans',-1

'mt little sister and i are self proclaimed horror movie buffs  we have seen just about everything  especially zombie flicks  now  we have seen a lot of good zombie movies  and a lot of bad ones  this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life  not only was the acting horrible  but the special effects  graphics and ever  zombie  make up was the worst i have seen  if you can even call it make up   black eye shadow around the eyes  this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it s cover  cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about  do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie                   i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying  this movie sucks  don t waste your time  return now  hahahhaa i don t want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie  i don t even know how it got the ratings that it did  t should be in the negative',-1

'someone actually gave this movie   stars  there s a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn t spend    seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary this film is     well     i guess it s pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn   snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits  apart from the acting  plot  story  sets  dialogue and sound   i wrongly assumed it was about zombies watching it is actually quite scary in fairness  you re terrified someone will come over and you ll never be able to describe what it is and they ll go away thinking you re a freak that watches home made amateur torture videos or something along those lines i m so taken aback i m writing this review on my mobile so i don t forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current     to save others from the same horrible fate that i just suffered i worst film i ve ever seen and i can say  with hand on heart  it will never  never be topped',-1

'this film has to be the worst i have ever seen  the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope  the story line of the film is laughable at best  with the acting so poor you just have to cringe  the title  zombie nation  implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total  this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy    s music when the zombies  attack   the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video  if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so  then burn the copy',-1

'i stopped by bb and picked up   zombie flicks to watch over the weekend  now  i understand that the effects will be cheesy  the acting will be sub par  and the sets will be suspect  so i m not expecting much  but it should at least have a story  stories don t cost a thing except time     apparently  they didn t have any time either  zombie nation  had   zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers  the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie  it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre the running time is only    minutes but it felt like   hours  according to my wife  who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room   it sounded like zombie porn    which if you think about  sounds kinda gross     but it wasn t even that good the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off  i rated it a   out of    because imdb won t allow me to use decimals',-1

'not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts  makeup that a child can do   acting was over done   poor directing   editing was very choppy   many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous   sound was badly dubbed   music was highly inappropriate   casting was extremely off   must have been on crack   zombies that talk let alone   drive  dance  work   just pisses me off   and the bad guy   holy crap  as horribly casted as he was   he was the best looking zombie of all  which doesn t say much the cover art was good but very deceiving   as was the main menu of the dvd   great artwork and music don t bother',-1

'thank god  i didn t waste my money renting it but i downloaded it  this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life  f     g visual effects  unnecessary gore and nudity  far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others  there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie  ok if you get time after reading this comment  please check out the director s ulli lommel  profile  after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this  i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between   and    and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him  but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence  even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie',-1

'usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant   i tend to support everybody  because their efforts are worth   but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits imagine the following situation    think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far    think about some great  attractive art for that movie s dvd box   and a promising plot      voil  you got zombie nation see it only if you really don t have anything else better to do  anything is better',-1

'notice i have given this   star if the option been given i would have given this zero  as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest  i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake  but it didn t prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best  do not let that fool you  this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it  the acting  if you can call it that   the  plot   so many holes must look like swiss cheese   and the special effects really are just terrible please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch in the end i m not saying i can make a better movie than this  but i am thinking it',-1

'if ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it s this pile of crap  i love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity  i actually began to feel angry watching this film because it s so insultingly poor  i can t believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable there s no plot and the non plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking  the people don t react  act or in any way resemble human beings  the entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be  the whole thing is one pointless mess  it doesn t go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don t do very much i could make a better film than this  so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before  it s pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time honestly  the very worst movie of all time  you ll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a       and urge you to buy the dvd  i can t imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film  it s terrible      and that s generous',-1

'this movie had me going  the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard  i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors  band together  and plan to take out the zombies  dead wrong  it s about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what s coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge  as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved  where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation first off  the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face  what are zombies but mindless  debatable intelligent  cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs  these zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models  they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies  sure the eating and killing is there  but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement  although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre  it makes fun of that genre and asks the question   why can t zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines   i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies  i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much  it s an insult and as for scarynot even',-1

'i only watched the first    minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap  the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie  no  it was a hundred times worse  ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that s not true  the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever the american cop has a german accent  the  police station  was a desk in a warehouse with a sign  police station  hanging on the wall  there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet this cop pulls women over  cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse  he tells his cop partner to wait in the car  then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag  the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right  that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women  but he isn t sure if that is what s happening because   he s a moron  the dialog is totally stupid  the acting is awful  and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen  it is totally obvious to the cop s partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it  and yet  the partner  who is there all along  doesn t know what is happening the director of this film is a total hack  i stopped the movie at    minutes because i couldn t take it anymore  it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won t waste anymore time on it writing this review absolutely worthless',-1

'zombie nation      rhey  i was bored  i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch  zombie nation  hey  i love zombie movies  says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description  funny how it doesn t warn me not to watch this film  i could ve used that advice zombie nation is just like troll   in that it s completely misnamed  it has little  if anything  depending on your point of view  to do with zombies  and takes place all within one city  this film revolves around a crooked cop  who acts as badly as possible  he has to be trying to suck this much   while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them  yup  he s a serial killer cop  not only is this film flawed in thinking that it s a zombie flick  it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong  serial killers enjoy killing  they live for it and they get down and personal with it  this guy knocks out the women  and injects them with some poison  he doesn t even have sex with the corpse or dismember it  talk about boring  eventually  one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason  all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy  they were all buried or tossed into the ocean  but you wouldn t know it buy the sharp clean clothes they re all wearing  the women then act very poorly and take their revenge  oh yay this film was crap in every category  crap acting  crap writing  crappier sets  and crappier make up effects  the women don t look zombie like  unless you count really dark make up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie  they can all talk  behave  think  and act perfectly human  the gore is weak compared to even many pg    films and the nudity is beyond brief  you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence    then the exact same breasts later  go figure  guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite  the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they re obviously filming in  you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set up and even  unless you are blind  you can see the director failing  steer clear  it s a waste of time',-1

'yeah  i m sure it really could be a nation       if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times  man  i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear net instead of renting it  i m a big fan of the george romero movies and i m pretty sure that if he saw this movie  he d probably throw up while laughing too hard  i mean  what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie s devils  it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer  especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop police station apartment flat whatever room it was with the gong in the background  and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop  i couldn t even tell what nationality the killer was  and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn t help either  oh well  what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world  so  for all of those who worship mystery science theater      or if you just like reaming on bad c movies  c for craptastic   then this is the movie for you       or not',-1

'last weekend i bought this  zombie movie  from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of  land of the dead  boy  was i wrong it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover art  which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone  they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him  but once they started driving the car  i couldn t suspend my disbelief anymore some people actually consider this a  so bad  it s good  movie  they are liars  i didn t finish the movie  but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie  which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through this is even worse than  zombiez  do not watch',-1

'german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible  he s unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium  this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of ew  i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set  the answer is  subterranean  lommel dug a pit and buried it the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies  only someone who has lived in los angeles  where every auto mechanic  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face the main character  a villainous beat cop  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent  aside from being a serial killer  he is also the oldest beat cop in la  despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody  then drags them into his home  which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse   and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners  the lapd refuses to investigate  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment the sets are excruciatingly bad  the production designer s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint  enough to paint  precinct      on a cardboard wall since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals  a sad assortment of european emigres  possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands   bimbos  mimbos  and desperate middle aged women  and since little if any money was spent on sets  special efx  locations or other production value  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms  sadly  they couldn t afford a police car  the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him  one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies  the other fits right in  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her  don t ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered  just accept lommel s logic and enjoy the absurd ride after much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance  they look exactly as they did before death  maybe even prettier  with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes  looking nothing like zombies  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll  and injects large doses of cheesy euro trash techno into the soundtrack  we re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise  stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty unlike other zombies  lommel s girls speak and function as normal    er  i mean  as they did before becoming zombified  this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog  yes  a golden shower it is i won t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending  all i can say is it s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece  the spirit of ed wood lives on    or should i say his geist',-1

'this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life  i m not even kidding  it was poorly made and the actors couldn t act  it was a waste of my time and money  it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own  the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise  nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case  it appears that the director or make up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie  the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost    minutes of the movie  which watching the credits was the best part of the movie  this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn t believe how badly it was put together  scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like  whats going on   the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen s joking around making a fake fight scene if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show s how awful it truly is  i wish i would have watched it before i rented it',-1

'horrible acting  bad story line  cheesy makeup  and this is just the tip of the iceberg  i have never seen a worse movie in my life    minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen    it didn t   aside from a nice breast shot  the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse  and the same warehouse was used for at least     of the sets  you even see this same red chair in several different  locations  if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment  not some warehouse which will echo all your actor s dialog    note to producers  renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse  and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable  if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee    you will be demanding your money back    i only spent       to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off',-1

'flight of fury  is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film   i don t expect a lot from a seagal film  all i expect is to be moderately entertained for    or so minutes with some mindless action  unfortunately this doesn t even achieve that low expectation  the action scenes are few and far between  the plot  which is totally irrelevant in these films  is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout  the acting is truly abysmal   bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of  rd raters   i find it hard to believe that anything close to    m was spent on this dire mess unless    m of that    was seagal s salary   i somehow doubt it  the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that   it s mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b movies i ve endured',-1

'it s one of those dramas that s so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny  the script is absolutely dire  direction appalling  lighting purely armature  the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it s good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad  it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard  but doesn t at least destroy any speeches  there s continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout  and finally last but not least the acting is appalling  for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this',-1

'when thinking about captivity many words come to mind  among them are  uninteresting  unentertaining  unsuspensful  unsexy  unfathomable  and unwatchable i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics  they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing  but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they re aimed at feel like they re hardcore and hip this movie is a load of boring crap  what the hell has happened to larry cohen  his name hasn t been attached to anything good since       even so  i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad  was anyone surprised when the movie s love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths  did anyone not know it when they first saw him  only someone who has never before in his or her life  ever seen another movie',-1

'i ll keep this short  thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly  captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl s drink  imprisons and tortures her  then poses as a captive to have sex with her  that is the single twist and punchline of the film  it s torture as slow motion date rape  and  it s not even a good movie  it s not so bad it s good  it s just bad it should also be mentioned that among critics  there is a  spoiler code  that they dare not break  even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile  why no one had the cojones to step up and say   this is garbage  and this is why   is beyond me don t give your money to these poop peddlers',-1

'absolutely fantastic now  before a legion of cinema purists choke on their latts  allow me to elaborate  much as i enjoyed it  this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i ve seen at the cinema  an impressive claim  as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen   the two leads  daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert  were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst  of course  they weren t helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne   celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence  the plot  to stretch the term slightly  was thin to non existent and the  gore  scenes  whilst undoubtedly brutal  were irrelevant and laughably formulaic  what plot there is revolves around a twenty something model  cuthbert  who is abducted  imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures  both psychological and physical  the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience  whilst there really are very  very few positives to draw from this film  its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film  i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema  within twenty minutes  the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout  for my part i came out flushed with laughter  buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film making  whichever way you look at it  this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film p s  i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free   so i can afford to laugh about it  i was still tempted to ask for my money back   it really was that bad',-1

'the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor  a holocaust survivor  part of mengele s experiments on twins  consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz  and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments  the movie obviously had great reviews  it s one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about i too  for a large part of the movie  got sucked into the emotion that the movie maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on  one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder  obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum  could only find the sweetest nectar   in one of the many dramatic sequences  as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center  the meaning of the word  forgive  is even debated  but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own  but by this time  the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more  after the  strong willed  eva kor forgives her  nazi captors  the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about  at least from the viewpoint of kor  the movie goes about following her  past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory  to me  this was the meat of the movie  surrounded by inedible fat of her  act of forgiveness   obviously  it was a very sick cow on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness  in order to heal wounds of the past  she makes her way to the  promised land  to meet with some arabs  to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis  including one at a jewish center in chicago  from then on  anyone not so teary eyed that they can t see the screen will find it hard pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements firstly  you immediately notice her body language  defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers  her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time  effort and money the entire act was  a rather annoyed dr sami advan  professor of education at bethlehem university  gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment finally  the debate at the jewish center in chicago  where she is  grilled  on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so  in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts i will cut to the chase  by the end of the movie  i was hoping i hadn t chosen to watch the movie  the movie was badly made  failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial  just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears  it showed that kor  the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion  her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness  at best  to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate lastly  is everyone so retarded today that they can t notice the difference between making peace and forgiving  quoting another imdb user   i don t see her forgiveness as being weak  quite the contrary  she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul  she wanted the suffering to be over  so she let it go   that would be the perfect layman s definition of making peace i guess  in a world of propaganda  blind faith and political correctness  there is no room to question those that have  gone through more than the human mind can fathom  p s  the dictionary certainly should go into all those books to buy lists everyone keeps making',-1

'i love all types of films  especially horror  that being said  survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it i can t give it any points on originality  there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes  or remaking what others have done  it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods  a crazed killer  and as of lately  throw in some crazy family  on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw  wrong turn  though the twist in that one is obvious   and others  survival falls up way short against comparable films  the plot was just not original in any way  some films can get by with a weak  and way over done  plot with superb acting  special fx  or a slew of other factors  survivial doesn t have any of that to bank on  if you will  note the following  the acting in the movie never took off  i don t knock or blame the actors for that  nor the director  the dialogue was at best mediocre  and the actors involved never showed  not saying didn t have  the talent to pull it off  i mention   standouts  the leading man in this film certainly has the look  but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film  the actor who portrayed greg also had potential  but we never got to see any of it  watch the movie to see why  you won t believe it    the grainy film look  ah yes  that little tid bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of  grindhouse  films  in today s film making  that has become a gimmick  it either works or it doesn t  in this case it just does not work  there are too many other flaws going on  so it winds up distracting from the film  not adding to it  that being said  i think they did a good job of adding that grain  that is some good  quality grain  i think with a different script  better direction  and possibly actors  they should try another  grindhouse  attempt  they will probably pull it off as far as the tech aspects  in my opinion  they never quite gelled for me either  better care could have been taken with audio  sounds like it was fed directly into the camera  but there is nothing wrong with that  and for being shot on dv  it was too soft for my taste that is all i have to say about that',-1

'this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen  the acting was terrible  horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot  i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone  what a waste of time  first  as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into  all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie  the prank phone calls  halloween night  a psycho  and one knife  its absolutely ridiculous  i was not scared at all during the movie  which i thought horror movies were supposed to do  as for the making of the movie  its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary  i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of  scary movie  for example  at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie',-1

'when it comes to horror movies  i am more than willing to suspend disbelief  ignore sub par production values  and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare  this movies simply has no good scares to offer  it can t even be enjoyed as camp  bad dialogue  bad acting  bad direction  the kills were predictable and poorly staged  the music was annoying  the camera work was wretched  even the costumes were bad  i felt really bad for the actors  who were obviously trying  but who had to deal with terrible  contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction  i doubt they got any rehearsal  either  it s embarrassing to watch  and so boring than making it through to the contrived  surprise  ending requires tremendous endurance  it s quite easily one of the worst movies i ve ever seen i don t normally write reviews  but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others  this movie is a complete waste of time  if you must watch this movie  don t miss the  making of  featurette  the writer director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold  daring move   seen it   he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it s a new age  citizen kane   it s like listening to a group of third graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant  they truly think they ve created something of substance  it s sad  really the only reason i gave this movie a     is because i think     should be reserved for true atrocities  like  manos  hands of fate  and  space mutiny   so  american nightmare  isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen  but i d have to say that it s somewhere in the bottom fifty',-1

'so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film  and you might be thinking to yourself   huh  there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december      funny thing is  most of these rave reviews sound like they re coming from the same person  or at best a small  coordinated group of  open house  groupies  the truth  my friends  is that this film is truly unwatchable  just because it s  independent  doesn t mean it gets a free pass  if you re going to make a musical  whether on film or on stage  whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse  you should probably make sure that  a   your actors can sing   b   your actors can dance   c   you have decent sound equipment   d   you have a well written score  and  e   you have lyrics that are witty and charming  even anthony rapp can t save this one  it s one of those unfortunate movie going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved',-1

'the single worst film i ve ever seen in a theater  i saw this film at the austin film festival in       and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival  it was an interesting premise  and seemed like it could go somewhere  but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything  first of all  if you re going to do a musical  find someone with musical talent  the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming  the lyrics were terribly written  and when they weren t obvious rhymes  they were groan inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work  and you d think you d find people who could sing when making a musical  right  not in this case  luckily they were half talking half singing in rhyme most of the time  but when they did sing it made me cringe  especially when they attempted to sing in harmony  and that just addresses the music  some of the acting was pretty good  but a lot of the dialog was terrible  as well as most of the scenes  they obviously didn t have enough coverage on the scenes  or they just had a bad editor  because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film  at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical  i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again',-1

'normally  i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet    well  this movie was just terrible  it is nigh on impossible to  suspend disbelief   i tried  really  i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn t let me timberlake should stick to music  what a dreadful performance   no presence as an actor no character  can t blame everything on justin  the movie also boast a dreadful plot   badly timed editing  its definitely an  f  after seeing this  i have to wonder what really motivates actors  i mean  surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part  did he not see how poor it was  what then could motivate him to take the part  money  of course  acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work ll cool j is a great actor  he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script meanwhile  the audience goes   what the hell is going on here  you expect me to believe this crap  in short  apart from justin a great lineup badly executed   very disappointing',-1

'this show is terrible  the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse  i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two  all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them  well at least corner gas was good at first  little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode    who are the people who are watching this show anyway  i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies  maybe the jokes are for them and they work there  i don t know a single person who likes this show and can t stand it myself  the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas  hopefully it won t last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could should have led to a great show',-1

'if you re looking to be either offended or amused or both  you ll probably have to look elsewhere  lmotp really isn t even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichs  at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it s just another lame  innocuous and anti septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing  and once the  zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao    hype wears out its welcome  the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it s so shallow when judged on its merits alone unless you re obsessed with muslim culture in the west and or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don t see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype  other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural ethnic dichotomy in western multi ethnic societies  lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight',-1

'i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all  the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it s getting talked about  i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason  they are usually true  but there really wasn t anything funny about these stereotypical characters  the  fresh of the boat  dad  who doesn t understand his daughter  the radical feminist muslim daughter  who by the way is a terrible actress   and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can  he s a pretty good actor  i only see him getting better  it is very contrived and the dialog doesn t flow that well  there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed  and don t really care to watch another episode i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again  she s always a treat and a natural at everything she does  too bad her daughter in the show doesn t have the same acting abilities',-1

'little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen  they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most easily offended viewers which for cbc means    year old farmers in saskatchewan  the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can t believe it  the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don t blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded  very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as  controversial  well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has    minutes  royal canadian air farce and rick mercer s report',-1

'this series just gets worse and worse  poorly written and just plain not funny  the premise is excellent  but the writer s inexperience shines through  by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone  now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about  and resorted to that patronizing  smug   oh  silly you  style acting that comes with a no laugh script  they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say  aren t we zany  isn t this funny  well  no  it s not actually  gum disease is less painful  no wonder  with the exception of corner gas  canadians generally avoid canadian tv  come on cbc you re suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent  pull the plug on this amateurish mess',-1

'once again canadian tv outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter  how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists  ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses  but not    minutes  it s called beating a dead horse  even snl would know to give up after a commercial break also  let s have a little conflict in these scripts  will she or won t she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on ramadan  when will ramadan start  ohhhhh this is emmy winning stuff here and the characters  what characters   they are all cardboard cut outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next  that s the point of the situation comedy  we need to have strong  interesting  dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week  we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they re going to get into next week  if i never see these characters it ll be too soon  thankfully i can t remember any of their names  note to cbc   that s not a good sign  and the acting is so bland  it s more so a problem in casting than in the actors  none of these people actually embody the characters they play  they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week  sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character   make us fall in love with them   where they become inseparable from the character the portray  watch any american sitcom and you ll see how easily identifiable characters are  part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next   years portraying  that level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows  but to be honest  considering the lame concept and the horrible writing  there s not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture  as another commenter mentions  this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom and the directing or lack there of  what can i say  canada has so much talent  look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and punched up  look at the trailer park boys  not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog   look at any american show to see the potentials our talent as that s where many of our stars go to find decent work give credit to the cbc  they really know how to build publicity for a non event  remember  the one   no   well don t even try to learn any characters names in this show  as it s sure to go the way of the dodo let s all hope for a full blown actra strike so that nothing like this emerges from the ceeb for a good long while',-1

'this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news  sports  or satirical sketch comedy  as a developer of situation comedy  cbc has shown it can combine the pizazz of  king of kensington  with the belly laughs of  the beachcombers   it is an embarrassment to great shows like  kids in the hall  and  second city  that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production i have to admit  that i didn t give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept  to start  half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip off one of the few sitcom successes in english canadian history   corner gas   the rest of the concept  the cultural clash  is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness  the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the  fish out of water  characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be  edgy  and  topical   but comes off as forced  some of the jokes that are based around the local s reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved  especially the audience this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn t  get it  when it comes to creating canadian content  especially when presenting canada as a multicultural environment  cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy handed and forced way  it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity  i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle  a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas  i e  the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines  more realistically  their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics that being said  even as a formulaic fish out of water comedy this show fails  the acting is weak  the comic pacing all over the map  and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief  even for a comedy  the only saving grace is the talented derek mcgrath  who is horribly wasted here  i doubt that even the addition of guest stars  colin mochrie  for example  as an anglican archbishop  can save this dog  i decided to give the show a chance once the cbc s  hype  had died down  but two episodes were all i could stand  i could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline  the time slot would be better served by airing more coronation street  air farce re runs  or dr  who  even an infomercial would be an improvement',-1

'i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever  i didn t realize it was disney until it was too late  i was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story  it was as if someone made a movie out of a  th grader s book report on the novel  meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses  mrs murray  meg s mother  was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all  they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet  and that s just the beginning  by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen  much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn t read the book  i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one  the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book  this movie is kinda alright',-1

'we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books  while not particularly accurate adaptations  these movies were nonetheless excellent films  some great examples are the harry potter series  the lord of the rings trilogy  and  to a lesser extent  almost every disney film ever made  however  i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies  not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l engle s fan base  it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting  acting  special effects and  ultimately  respect for the audience  mind you  i m not trying to be mean  on the contrary  i went into this affair with an open mind  i figured that a made for t v  movie would make up for its lack of razzle dazzle in its script  after all  the star wars spin off ewoks was decent  if a little silly  come to think of it  the original star wars was made on  a lunch money budget   and look where it took george lucas  however  from the first scene onward  disappointment started enveloping me as if i d gotten too close to the black thing while tessering the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of       a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic   mrs  whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time  the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief  aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard  star trek  first contact and radio  as our favorite star turned mentor  the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow  that s right  a crow  moreover  the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight year old  the majestic half man  half horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle  had i been five  this would have psychologically traumatized me for life  the worst part is the fact that when it spoke  it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync  resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single  unmoving cheek  thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e t having gotten the most painful part out of the way  i must go on to the tear inducing one  the characters  the acting  and the story  i  personally  had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films  plain hair  glasses  and a figure most supermodels would find laughable  she was always a slightly anxious  humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua  in the film  she is an unpleasant know it all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever  in fact  she makes me feel sorry for poor mr  jenkins  her school principal  who continuously has to deal with her  calvin  the kind  intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock  the irony is horrible  as for the memorable happy medium  they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is  above gender  and likes to look at  funny  things  such as girls falling off of swings  the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace  mrs  whatsit and the man with red eyes  nicknamed  the dude with red eyes  due to his complete reinvention as a character  the story is a mess  a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  which didn t do a good job of retelling the story found in the book  yet kept the sole of the original work  here  the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld  apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed  as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen  the flat nosed wookies of ixchel  who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks  tear the spine up  as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth like camazotz was  the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil i am very sorry that this film exists  i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad  it s the way the characters are written that ruins it  a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan  directed by george lucas or steven spielberg  enhanced at industrial light and magic  scored by john williams  given its sound at skywalker sound  edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox  in its current state  the film is unworthy to be shown to self respecting people  even madeleine l engle thought it was bad  the book was good  the film was bad  and mrs  whatsit was ugly score          if i could pros they got the names right cons it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation  script  acting and special effects  not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book  oh  and the main cover poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle  some might say that this symbolizes high adventure  i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn t even bother to photoshop meg s arm on properly',-1

'this movie barely followed the story line of the movie  all of the fascinating points in the book didn t even exist in the movie  they ended up turning it into a cheesy  tween  disney movie  crush  story between meg and calvin  it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part  or one of the likes  this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book  i can t believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap  basic rendition  if you ve ever read the book  i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of  lord of the rings  equivalence  this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time  poorly done',-1

'this may be a bit on the spoilerish side  i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie  nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed  that of course is the problem with taking  what many believe to be an amazing book  and turning it into a disney made for tv movie a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago  it s got a great storyline that could hook children and adults  plus it s got built in quality sequels  but disney fying was not the way to go  the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book  it is a complicated and emotional story for kids  there was no reason to make charles wallace purely  psychic   because that was the easiest way of explaining it  there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs  w s as added tension  there is enough tension in the story without that  there was no reason to remove meg s glasses    that deprived us of what could ve been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book i could nitpick for days about little things  but i also think larger things  like the art direction was a off  take for instance the way they made camazotz look  with its strangely darkened skies  the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth  it looks like earth  it has people on it that look like humans  the skies are blue  the grass is green  and there are children playing  but something is a little bit off  the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie  the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth  that is if we forget how to love  it would ve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they re walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm i unfortunately did not watch the end  maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well overall an artistic disappointment',-1

'i really didn t like this movie because it didn t really bring across the messages and ideas l engle brought out in her novel  we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it  i m afraid i can t say the same for the film  there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn t do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l engle  this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating  don t see this movie if you are a big fan of l engle s texts because you will be sorely disappointed  however  if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes  or educational as was my case  then it is an alright movie',-1

'i have read the whole  a wrinkle in time  book and then saw the movie  the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was     pages and the film was   hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg  charles wallace  and calvin must team together to find meg s father and get off the island camazotz the beginning of the film is really a stinker  the acting is awful  the direction is laughable  and so far the situations aren t necessary  i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie  made a great book  and a terrible film  the acting is worse than any straight to video acting  yes  i got to admit there was cool effects  but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible  if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie  i wish could give it a   but sadly i can only give it    a half could have been useful',-1

'this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues  that is no exaggeration  you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin elvira suicides at the end  but instead of this  in every scene somebody is trying to explain   when he was young  this happened     and  he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there      etc soon in the movie  erwin elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute  certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat   and while telling her the story of elvira s life  fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other  it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying  of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of  i have suffered much in my life  and am about to die  in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something  erwin elvira encounters a former lover  that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys  as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality  is that he recognizes elvira there are some interesting shots and ideas  i must admit  such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin   but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder s self  indulgence',-1

'stars out of a possible      and that is being overly generous i thought with a cast of james woods  cathy bates  randy quaid  lou gossett  jr   and henry thomas   how could it miss  i was wrong i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week end he cranked out this piece of dribble  i d long suspected sam s  of being kind of nuts  this film  based on his play  confirms it this is the kind of artsy b s  that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote  however  for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash  there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie you haven t seen dysfunctional families until you ve seen this bunch  pa is crazy  ma is crazy  the son is crazy and the daughter is  oh yeah  crazy  they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush  especially the teenage daughter in addition to the above  as if that weren t enough  the plot  and it s so thin you could read thorough it  has a hole in it the size of alaska ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm  as it turns out so is pa  now i don t claim to be a real estate expert  but the last time i checked  property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold  if only one of them owned the property  then the other could not legally sell it  so it would be pointless for that person to do so  mr  shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact  and therefore  his plot does not work not that anything else was really working anyway the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity  and i can t imagine why anyone would want to',-1

'before seeing this movie  i would ve said that i loved everything kathy bates has done  now it s everything minus one  james woods is pathetic   not his character  his acting  someone should ve told him that  poor  is not synonymous with dirty  nor ignorant  nor cliche  ditto for randy quaid s stereotyping  the only redeeming feature is henry thomas  who isn t a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess  if you enjoy the country  you ll enjoy the scenery  that s the best i can give it i m a serious fan of both independent and quirky films  but this is simply terrible',-1

'this would ve been a  great  silent film  the acting really is good  at least in a look ma  i m doing really big acting  sort of way everything is huge  every line is profound  every scene is shattered by human tragedy mostly  i felt like gagging  yet  like any train wreck  i couldn t tear my eyes away  this dialogue might ve worked on the stage  although i doubt it  on the screen  it was cluttered  haphazard  hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work if you enjoy your melodrama in huge  heaping doses  you  might  enjoy the movie  be prepared to wait  however  for all that melodrama  this thing sure plods along at its own pace this script must ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves  it simply doesn t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera imdb does us a great disservice  at times  when it uses its goofy computer controlled  weighted score   curse of the starving class deserves less than a   character driven fiction is great  but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution  it isn t character development  your characters must have a motivation  being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is  not  character development  that s a plot contrivance stay away from this movie  or at the very least  watch it muted  perhaps you ll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do oh  and word to the wise    to prove that this is truly an artsy film  you see james woods in all his dangly male  look at me  i m the figurative and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of  man  glory don t say you weren t warned',-1

'how many more of those fake  slice of life  movies need to be made  hopefully not too many raising victor vargas is a very self conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood  nothing wrong with that in general  what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich in the book of supposedly  edgy  hollywood independent production it s supposed to be  real  so left shake the camera  documentary style   except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose   it s  edgy  so let s not waste any time lighting the film it s  hip   so let s have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface   and so on  and so forth  all that you are left with is a very self conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won t impress anyone outside of the  rarefied  indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film',-1

'ok  i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a  classic  and a standard part of most people s childhood  but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of     i must admit  i really hated it we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it  and many people who whimpered at the very words  watership down   their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams  recommended it  to be honest  i wish i hadn t bothered  i gave it the benefit of the doubt  generally i don t like to stop watching a film half way through  this was an exception  it was really  really  excruciatingly  sickeningly dull  this film was possibly the slowest thing i ve ever watched  imagine a doped up snail in space   and really didn t  do it  for me  the art was alright  the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee  yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced i m not going to go into huge details about the storyline  basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area  generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment  it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across  for me  i kind of wished that they would get gassed  not because i m a horrible sadistic person  but because the characters were uninspiring  annoying  dull and generally quite rude  oh i m so terribly english   i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film  and it took a whole    minutes or so before anything actually happened  and even that was a terrible anticlimax if i were to praise it in any way  i d have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well meaning  maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy  but the message it s trying to put forth is good in its nature  the musical score was not bad  too so  to conclude  this film is pretty poor  i couldn t watch it the whole way through  or i d probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom  granted  it isn t  torque  bad  but it still doesn t rate highly in my eyes  so i ve given it a      hope this helps',-1

'i saw this movie as a very young girl  i m    now  and it scared me witless for years  i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to  obviously  the violence  my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie  i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it     i am currently reading the book  out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it s a classic  and it is really a great story  however i don t think that it should have been made into a cartoon  ever  well  maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way  gives me a little heart palpitation every time  yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids  read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content  not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there',-1

'firstly  i am not easily scared by    anything except for my few phobias  but this movie is absolutely horrific  this is not appropriate for children at all  i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i  couldn t believe how gory it was for a children s movie  bunnies being brutally murdered  it s just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g  i recommend being over   to see this  but don t get me wrong  it was probably a good movie if i wasn t scarred mentally as a child  i cannot believe a parent would allow a  let s say    year old child to watch this  it s just to intense and complicated  not to forget gory  for young kids  i m wayy over   and i was shocked by the violence  i don t recommend',-1

'so    it s really sexist  and classist  and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie  like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change  well  he certainly changed his tune  and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit  what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers  the end of the movie does not make her a hero  it makes the whole thing sad  and its sad that people think it makes her a hero  perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away  positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience  yuck',-1

'i should love this movie   the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me   the movie makes working class people look low and cheap  the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy   barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family   i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it again the acting was very very good and worth watching   i really don t like the story line   just a personal preference  thank you',-1

'i loved the first season  the quality went down a little bit in the second season  which however had a great middle  pegasus    third season was fairly novel and original and was ok  fourth season started going downhill fast  because they never even began giving us any explanations  when by now we were really starting to need them  what the hell was the cylon plan  why were there two cylon factions  what was the point of angel kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth    what kind of a past did the last five cylons have  and how did they survive  or were they reincarnations  questions everywhere  answers nowhere and then comes the end  earth    our earth  in the past  well  okay  but destroying the fleet   giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life  and spreading a few thousand people paper thinly across the planet   that s not only anti science  it s anti reason and anti life  and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a i  that ruins everything  it is without vision  without hope for a grander future for humanity  and it is antithetical to proper science fiction  and don t even get me started on the angels  religious claptrap of the worst kind  the ultimate disappointment  the whole  all this has happened before and will happen again  thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series  not just to earth as we know it  making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius  frakkin shame   out of',-1

'oh dear lord  how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone  it reeks of cheese from start to finish  but it s not even good cheese  it s the scummiest  moldiest  most tasteless cheese there is  and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually  truly enjoyed it  yes  if you saw it with a load of drunk stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way  but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen  i watched it with an up for a few laughs guy  having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film s expected crapness  we got the crapness  plenty of it   but not the chuckles  it doesn t even qualify as a so bad it s good movie  it s just plain bad  very  very bad  here s why  look away if you re spoilerphobic   the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death  ok  i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was  but i think i grasped the  this guy is a bit of a badass who you don t want to mess with  message behind the ingenious scene  oh  and a guy witnesses it  so  we already have our ultra evil bad guy  and wussy but cute  apparently  good guy  cue hero  big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion  saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish  i e  hero is immune to bullets  everyone else falls over rather clumsily  cue first plot hole  how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was  or that he d watched the murder  perhaps this  and the answers to all my plot hole related questions  was explained in the   minutes before i got into the cinema  but i doubt it  in fact  i m going to stop poking holes in the plot right here  lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese  which we all know is good cheese   so  the  plot   a very generous word to use   good guy must get to la  evil guy would rather he didn t  hero sam stands between the two  cue scenery for the next vomit inducing hour   the passenger plane  as i said  no more poking at plot holes  i ll just leave it there  passenger plane  next  the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie  and what makes it everything it is   snakes  yay  oh  pause  first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have  hot  horny couple  see if you can guess how they die   dead before any snakes even appear british guy  those pesky brits  eh    cute kids  and jo brand  for all you americans that s an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness  now that we ve met the cast  let s watch all of them die  except of course the cute kids   don t expect anything original  it s just snake bites on various and ever increasingly hilarious  really not  parts of the body  use your imagination  since the film makers obviously didn t use theirs so  that s most of the film wrapped up  so now for the best bit  the ending  as expected  everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face  yep  ice cool sammy included  but wait  we re not all off the plane yet  the last guy to get off is good guy  but just as he does he gets bitten by a  you guessed it  snake  of all things   clearly this one had been hiding in mr  jackson s hair the whole time  since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier  despite the    ft constrictor  the one that ate that pesky british bugger  being unable to  so  sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop  at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much needed u turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort  but no  in a kind of icing on the cake way  but with stale cheese  remember   it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest  how anyone can think that an audience    years ago  let alone in      would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me  but it did well in summing up the film actually  we re not quite done yet  after everyone has sucked face  uncle sam with leading actress  good guy with tiffany  token black guy with token white girl  and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia   it s time for good guy and hero to get it on    in bali    nope  it wasn t at all exciting  the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll  yes  the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred  and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times  that s it  this is the first time i ve ever posted a movie review  but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography  if you like planes  snakes  samuel l jackson  air hostesses  bad guys  surfing  dogs in bags or english people  then please  please don t see this movie  it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you ll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again  go see united    instead  that was good',-1

'this movie was the worst movie i have seen since  date movie   i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared  it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example  the eye  the tongue  the butt  the breast  if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite  for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person  i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior  i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie so i don t recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it',-1

'i saw the   p m  showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special  although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back  as i don t actually pay for movies anymore  i didn t really find any redeeming qualities there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle  but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger  in mind more than age as this film is rated r  male audience  the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well  i know you all want to hear samuel l  say his infamous line  but let s be honest  it s a whole lot of hype for very little pay off  the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg  which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen now i am a reasonable man  i knew going into the theater that i wasn t going to be seeing  casablanka   and i am at least thankful that this film is an original  albiet inane  idea and not some re make or franchise spin off  however to be honest  if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months',-1

'this movie deserves more than a    but i m giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a    resulting in it getting a rating that ll take it into the top     list  seriously it s not that great its not that bad  its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it s ridiculous  these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say  i m rick james b tch  no matter how old or annoying it gets  i dread having to hear  i m tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane  months from now from idiots trying to be funny  its crappy plot crap acting etc  its okay to love a bad movie  but you still gotta admit its a bad movie wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie',-1

'when discussing a movie titled  snakes on a plane   we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes  snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy  they crawl they slither  these snakes do nothing of the sort  they glide along like they would in a video game  they are cartoon snakes  i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scarywhy on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures  why not rely on suspense   the whole  less is more  ethic  or better still  why not just make them look good in the first place  and then maybe still use them sparinglytake one look at john carpenters  the thing   here we have real slime  and gore of eerie proportions     years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap  snakes on a plane   when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee  special effects are going backwards sure you could say   but the movie is a joke  get it  sure i m with that idea  but do it well  in addition to the above  this movie has crap dialogue  and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way i could handle every other actor being part of this movie  except for jackson  what was he doing there  the man who starred in pulp fiction    years ago  is this career progression  are you offering people value for money  no  i d like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a moviethe current generation seem to have very low expectations  and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want  on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including    doa  dead or alive   another  cgi animal film called  flushed away   and another crap looking comedy named  click   in addition to that i saw some awful trailers  including one for  another  crap british horror comedy  i ve truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long timeexpect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for   in   months time  and if you re expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes  and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips  forget it',-1

'pyramid clues  deep blue sea  tremors  slither  eight legged freaks pyramid category  movies that were funnier and more thrilling than snakes on a plane hell  with that definition i d have to include the relatively harrowing journey of ted and elaine in airplane  as superior to snakes in both laughs and thrills the sad truth is that this isn t even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies  anaconda  besides the never to be seen again casting of jlo cube o wilson stoltz wuhrer in the same flick  you had jon voight pulling off the all time cinematic heist  his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a  so ludicrous it s fun  movie in the end  snakes on a plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible  every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year  all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater  i heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for  according to jim',-1

'i d give this a negative rating if i could  i went into this movie not expecting much  but i had an open mind  the whole thing is stupid  the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson  oh how original  if i were a    year old boy i might laugh at that  i have no idea how this movie became so popular  seriously the worst thing i ve ever seen  i wasn t entertained  it wasn t funny i wasn t even bored  i wasn t anything  it wasn t even so bad it was good  it s just bad  ridiculous actually  please do not waste your money on this movie  don t even rent this movie  no clue how it s getting such a high rating',-1

'i went into this film with expectations  from the hype  that it would be insightful and uplifting  certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band  wilco  instead we get a lot of moping and whining about  the process   a dishonorable and no doubt one sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer songwriter  a gut wrenching confession by the fallen member s friend    for like    years    saying the  friendship had run its course   and this whiny  uncompelling story about how one record label  hurt their feelings  by dumping them  only so that the band could immediately get    offers from other labels  oh  the tension   not   they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain  but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn t exist  this doesn t even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline  insight or even a decent job at cinematography  the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch from the film  this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don t have and think they re some kind of guardians for the art of music  which they most definitely are not  and i thought the music sucked  and i couldn t even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer i give it a',-1

'disjointed  unclear  bad screenplay  poor photography and direction   all in all very obviously an ill conceived first effort at commercial film making by the good people at tbn tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring  china cry   the story of nora lam  to the big screen  but  the omega code  is an unfortunate miscue  as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved  china cry   i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone  they do much good with their ministry  but this isn t an example of it  don t waste your money   go rent  china cry  instead',-1

'raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be  being real  unfortunately  there is no reality to this film  the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake the reason  bad directing  peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal  it seems mr  sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel  wrong  it just gives it a badly made feel  similarly  shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film  it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what s on screen instead of enhance it of course  what s on screen is so painfully fake  as if mr  sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look  hip  to his sundance buddies and show how  edgy  a filmmaker he is overall  the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr  sollett is  next time  how about taking a few writing and directing classes',-1

'interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code    many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts    the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video  to be stocked besides the three part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the   s   dont remember it  you wont remember this one either in a year or two  this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls    very shameful    this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist s son  you too can play high roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money',-1

'this film had so much promise  i was very excited about this film  in the end  it was laughable at best  painful at worst  the acting styles ran the gamut from really  really  flat  the angels  the wife and daughter  to over animated  casper s character   i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other  pay special attention to the scene regarding  the bug   it s pretty much an insult to the audience s ability to figure things out  in defense of that scene  though  it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie  i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations  too bad they didn t make use of it  i didn t feel like i was transported to exotic locations  anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome  however  to end on a positive note  i thought the sets were pretty good  i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers  it is my opinion and that s all it is  that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased  this film would have been good',-1

'this movie is not based on the bible  it completely leaves christ out of the movie  they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ  let alone talk about it  it does not quote from scriptures  the end times are called the great tribulation  the movie does not even show bad times  the seven bowls  seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a    second news cast of the sea changing it s structure  the anti christ was killed       years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended  the only part they got correct was there was two prophets  the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures  the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie  i wanted to take unsaved people to it  i feel that the movie is evil  it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does  i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books the second problem with the movie is it was just bad  bad acting  bad special effects  bad plot and poor character development  i have seen better episodes of miami vice',-1

'i truly wish i was not writing this review  i m a christian  so i waited anxiously to see this movie  it seemed great    a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing  not that i buy the bible code itself    you can make it say anything you want  i do  however believe everything inside the bible   so i m sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews  when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes  i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater  i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes  i m sure   once the final credits began to roll  however  i could reflect  there were many parts of the movie i liked    some mostly unexpected plot twists  some effects that were indeed special  i m not counting the visions  those were poorly done   and some interesting technical work    fades  sets  that type of thing  unfortunately  i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour  i could ve gotten a better script  and the music was beyond cheesy  even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue   so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater    like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was    but i m not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it  i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies  and this just didn t have either  i m sorry  but i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone  and that s the tragedy  when will we see some intelligent christian fiction  it has to be out there somewhere',-1

'the more i analyze this film  the worse it becomes  first of all  why a motivational speaker  that part was just stupid  i mean  why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker  is alexander stone really that disorganized  first he can t decide what he wants to do to control the world  so he looks to the bible for ideas  many of these ideas  i might add  really have no reliability for example  the part of the  the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror  could have already happened  it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something   and gillen lane s family  they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water  i might add that since casper van dien gillen lane is only in his twenties or that s the impression that i had and has a ten year child  he had his child during high school  yeah  there goes tbn s family values  also  why did this film have to be so damn propaganda like  i ll repeat what an earlier reviewer said  the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated  this film doesn t do that  the beginnig starts off well  with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy s omega code  then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of  the two prophets tell him  tell your master that we are here    dominic ironsides  replies  he already knows  and points to a small surveillance camera  that part sent chills up my spine  had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film  i ll give michael york credit  he does a fine job of acting out his character  as does michael ironsides  but the good guys are horrible  i ve already went on about lane s family  now that i m over the acting  i ll get on to plot  this is obviously a baptist film  since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf  the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle  as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well done  also another diatribe against the vatican  their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded  since gillen explains to the pope that it s not the end of the world  but the beginning of a new one also  the vatican  or israelis says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world  whoever it was  they wouldn t just secede  they d send over commandoes and kill them  this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying  we re not going to talk to you any more    come on  i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor  mediocre in short',-1

'if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become  this one would take the prize  the plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world  just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be the acting was bad at best  casper van dien wasted his talent doing this film  michael york s work was a fair match for the role  since he was the center of the film  and did a good job this plot was sickening and very disturbing  no tender or immature minds should see this film  this is how a basic good vs  evil plot can go astray there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles  who look for ways to market this type of junk  there must have been something censored out to get a pg    rating  but it was still awful',-1

'i didn t know what to expect from the film  well  now i know  this was a truly awful film  the screenplay  directing and acting were equally bad  the story was silly and stupid  the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film  but he didn t  i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad  where was the focus to the film  where was anything in this film  christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it  it was shabbily done and a waste of my money  do not see this film',-1

'yes i admit i cried during this movie  it was so incredibly disappointing  that i couldn t help myself but cry  tbn  trinity broadcasting network  has done it again  first with having the million dollar man  ex professional wrestler  on their program  and now this the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies  it was quite amusing  yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate  the movie follows what is known as  the bible code  rather than following actual biblical scripture  this film is extremely poorly made  from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting  its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie  it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie i highly recommend you do not watch this movie  even if your life depended on it',-1

'this movie basks too much in its own innocence  it doesn t tell a story  it s more a big time snooze fest  while the actors are all personable  the story is so trite and goes nowhere  i think victor rasuk has great charisma  but deserves a real film from a real storyteller',-1

'what else is left to say i ve read all the reviews here and most are right on    however  one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it  or something along those lines   evil   wow  what a shocker    i mean  tbn basically made this film  open your eyes please anway  this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it  if this movie can be made  there are no limits  and therefore  we have no choice but to get ready for  yentl     and  ernest loses the omega codes  for those of you who are into the biblical stories  the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started',-1

'quite honestly  the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time  during the first    minutes i sat stunned in my seat  trying to decide if i should demand a refund  but since i hadn t paid to see it in the first place  passes   i figured i might as well stay  and i didn t think it could possibly get any worse it did  i will quickly run through the low points  includes some spoilers   the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane  a motivational speaker with two phds  the characterization was inconsistent  for example  lane  despite his credentials  is a complete nitwit  then there s the lame o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies  we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code  also  terrible  action  sequences  lane escapes from tough situations without explanation  and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger  it turns out to be a dream sequence  that s cute for grammar school writing assignments  but it s an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture  the pacing was bad  after a long opener  the first third of the movie changes scenes every    seconds  later  the pacing improves  but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around  and as someone else mentioned  years pass yet no one  not even lane s young daughter  ages  that was disconcerting there are a few good things  though  the quality of the film  e g  lack of graininess  is high and very attractive  the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism  also  there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god  finally  to help him   this proved to be quite exhilarating   even to me  someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior  but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie  unfortunately  it was followed by major incomprehensibility the characters  dialogue  direction and acting were all poorly done  michael ironside had nothing to do  and michael york was just weird  i think the producers wanted to do too much  if the plot had been tighter and more focused  and the characterization more fleshed out  the film would have been far better in a nutshell  the omega code disappoints  definitely do not pay to see this  i give it    out of ten stars',-1

'i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character  words cannot describe  nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was  but please allow me to try to describe it  horrible acting  terrible dialog  corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network  its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep  religious message attached to it  they failed miserably  it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time',-1

'i am a youth pastor s wife and we took some youth to see this film  we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them  they didn t get it and i didn t enjoy it  it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world  the bible code  the torah code and the code in the koran  and is so questionable as to be laughable  this is not a step forward for christians in the arts  it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door',-1

'i m a christian  i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians  however  as a rule  they are  know nothings  when it comes to movie production  i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen  however  they did a hideous job of it  the acting was horrible  and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion  one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across  not only was the movie terribly made  but the people who made it even had some facts wrong  however  in this  critique   those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into  in short  the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen  and i would not recommend it to anyone  except for comic relief from the every day grind',-1

'i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons  for the first half hour it s actually pretty decent  although the acting isn t any better then that which you would find in a rap video  its kinda funny and the production value doesn t seem half bad  in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao  another recent dominican film  which turned out to be much much better than i expected  the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole  which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic  unfortunately i don t think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter  and they f ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them  about    minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits  not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge  space age  cgi effects dating to what i m guessing would be the    s  but the whole plot just goes down the drain  the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations  and clever one liners  to top it all off  and i guess i should warn you now   spoiler alert    it all turns out to be a dream  oh my who didn t see that coming  oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie  well after about an hour into it i start thinking  hmmmm something just doesn t seem right about the sound track but what can it be    and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter    when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art     perhaps a comedy to match france s amelie  or an action flick to match thailand s ong bak  an animation as akira was to japan  a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england  or a socio awakening journey as waking life had here in the states    i would give it a   but i ve seen much worse come out of dr  search los jodedores and you ll know what i m talking about',-1

'someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo gritty look is somehow seen as  realistic  by some people i didn t see anything realistic about the characters  although the actors did their best with really bad parts  or the situations  instead  i saw a forced  self conscious effort at being  edgy    gritty  and  down and dirty  sadly  it takes a lot more than hand holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way it s a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies  with bad cinematography  non existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as  art  it s little wonder that films like  in the bedroom  or  about schmidt  get such raves  i found them to be meandering and very average  but compared to the current slew of independent clones like  raising victor vargas  they are outright brilliant and inspired a few years ago seeing an  independent  film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care  and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets  nowadays  it means that chances are you ll get yet another by the numbers  let s shake the camera around for two hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors  and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies  not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them',-1

'it has a great name  but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money  in fact the first      mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone and yet the producers  roberto angel salcedo  calls him an actor  but i don t think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting      period  the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it  but they didn t   and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad  i don t buy it but hopefully this is as bad as it gets  to make people accept those dvd s to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it  that might work out maka',-1

'the film is poorly casted  except for some familiar old hollywood names  other performances by unknown names  i e   jennifer gabrielle  are uninspiring  i have seen other films by this director  unfortunately this is one of his worst  perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay in a positive note  kim bassinger s and pat morita s performance saved the movie from oblivion  i enjoyed pat more in karate kid  though  there are many good movies to see  and in short  this one is not one of them  save your money and the celluloid jason vanness',-1

'elvis has left the building and he s lucky because he didn t have to watch this unfunny stinker  scene after scene director joel zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing  filled with unfunny deaths  trite gay characteratures  and hack jokes  this film is more desperate than amusing  this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into premature retirement  let us remember her the way she was  talented  and not what she s become  david leisure  the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here  zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn  the guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than the king the only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a preteen  she really looks like her and is actually pretty good  the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo  the cameo isn t all that funny  but at least its not painful  one has to wonder if zwick has incriminating pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie',-1

'i notice that the previous reviewer  who appears to be still at school  gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn t seen the far superior      bbc adaptation of this classic novel  the major problem i had with this        version was the casting of anthony way as tom long  anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini series  the choir   i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in  the choir   unfortunately the small boy who appeared in  the choir  had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time  tom s midnight garden  was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom  it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom  as played by anthony  would befriend the far younger hatty  in the      bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable  for a      movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the      tv effects  the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic  as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the      bbc version fetches well over       second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under       need i say more',-1

'i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy  i know i wouldn t have the nerve to go even   feet away from a croc but  everything in this movie is bad  farting jokes  people getting eaten  and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time it s a really bad film that you have to stay away from  all the  jokes  are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid  the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is   years old i m surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this',-1

'when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichs that you can guarantee will follow   the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local  dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens  what  who  how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst    the van will break down    whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about   they will find a house inhabited by a madman  he will capture them     the house will have a phone but it will not work  it will be disturbingly decorated  there will be flickering neon light  spiders and maggots    the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won t start  here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor     the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap  weak scare and will then be killed properly    only a girl will be left alive from the group    there will be an unnecessary twist at the end add to these elements naked sirens  who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately  that seduce and kill the teens  throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film  darkhunters  which is one of the worst films i have ever seen  at times the cinematography is very good  the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies  i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity  however  the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film  it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again  but amongst the dvd extras if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director s commentary it is beyond belief  there is more to say about this than the film itself  one staggering part of the commentary is the director s claim that the film is clich leaden because it was a preconceived idea  he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichs and openly he wonders if  people will get it  i m afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichs within them then it is not wittily scripted enough  acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work  if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question   what was the point   this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies  any attempt to do something clever or different haven t worked the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats  they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use  however  the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary  there is a simple distinction to be made here  mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style  roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures   i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant the best moment is reserved for robert s comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film  those who didn t like it are generalised as  geeks  and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that  i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn t singled out for ridicule  the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers  complete with  hilarious  accents to imply that people from norway wouldn t know a good film simply because of where they are born  as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting  they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast  robert s swears blind in voice over   i didn t want to make a film that was like baywatch  as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground  there is also a simpering  self indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert s says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is  the best british film in years   i don t know who he is trying to convince  at one point in the commentary track robert s says jokingly  i can see people sitting at home saying  this isn t amazing  its sh t  he isn t wrong',-1

'note to horror fans  the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted    minutes of your life on a movie that s so worthless it s insulting i watched this because the premise sounded slightly promising  it s not  it s just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low budget slasher films that weren t good either the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful  it s not  it s so not  the amateur cinematography makes sure the  fallen angels  are about as sexy as the average homeless person the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre  he s the king of low budget special effects and lower budget acting  come to think of it  savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie  it s not that he s bad  but he s almost always in bad movies  his only good role was in from dusk till dawn  and he s been milking that at horror conventions ever since but let s focus on the positive  forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie everything else is a negative  obviously the writer is allergic to originality  the script is terrible  that s all a given after the first    minutes  but the clueless pacing  the way the director treats  plot  and  characterization  as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway  and the excruciatingly long and boring driving  walking  and nature sequences  no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution  show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general this is another good example of the number one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad  if it s written and directed by the same person  expect garbage',-1

'according to imdb takashi miike s master of horror segment  imprint  was banned in the us  so i figured i d translate the swedish review i just wrote for it   it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killer director takashi miike s episode in the masters of horror series  and the dvd cover of imprint did in deed look very promising the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello  some time during the   th century  and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo  the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for  tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello  hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey  it turns out that one of the prostitutes  a deformed and quiet girl  know about komomo  and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left  the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow   the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent american english  but i will leave it at that  it s not that big a deal  what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was  miike s tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn t help looking at my watch several times during the    minutes  the extended torure scene  that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie  felt so unmotivated   and pornographically intrusive   that not even that scene became interesting  i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself   with no sense of style or purpose  the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water   and  in all honesty  the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago  for me most memorable as frank nitti   al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables         i ve always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy  and i mean that in a good way   and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible  not in a good way  in this one  his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting  when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa  twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago  i m grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh  memoirs of a geisha         who plays the deformed prostitute the finale is probably supposed to be chocking  maybe even revolting and horrid  but i just found it to be kind of   you know     blah   and i looked at my watch again  for the umptieth time  just wishing the crappy episode would end   maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit  but that s only because i couldn t help thinking of an episode of red dwarf  and the upside down chins of craig charles and danny john jules  with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens    lucky you  if you ve seen that episode and now decide to see imprint  i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you my first thought  when imprint finally ended  was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it  was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur  the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series   and that   if anything   is a big friggin warning  don t you think one might point to the costume design  by michiko kitamura  and say that there  at least  is something not lacking in style and refinement   but there are so many other films and tv shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese  geisha fashion   this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed  takashi miike s masters of horror episode is boring  uninspiring and pointless  in other words  it s really  really bad',-1

'van damme  what else can i say  bill goldberg  there we go  now we know this movie is going to be really horrible i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs  knowing it would be bad  but not even i thought it would be this bad  the plot is awful  van damme is getting old  finally   but unlike arnold  his movies are as well forget this movie  don t see it  ever  i wouldn t even be paid to see this film     stars   at its heart lies a wonderful  action packed thrill ride well  maybe not  but the marketers would sure like us to think so  wouldn t they john ulmer',-1

'this movie was absolutly awful  i can t think of one thing good about it  the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them  the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed  and that is saying alot    and dialogue  what dialogue   to think that i was a fan of the first one  i use that comment loosely  its more like a guilty pleasure  than anything else   this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud     nothing good can come of this movie  what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can t even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of    this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time       because it is soo hard for me to give a',-1

'this is a piece of s  t   this looks worse than a made for t v  movie  and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results    war is prettier than this  jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now  no script  no story and no time should be wasted on this  i mean that    out of    is too high  way too high  goldberg should be jackhammered for this  van shame is no actor',-1

'here be spoilers   the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program  now called unisol  the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before  however the government is downsizing  the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened  so he takes steps to ensure his own safety  he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem  the only one who can stop them is deveraux  van damme  this movie is about one thing  choreographed fighting  the story is bad  and is soon drowned in all fights  whatever happens  and wherever they go  they fight  unfortunately for this movie  it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible  normally you re pretty sure the hero will win  but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants  not where one is indestructible and can t lose  then the fights just become a tool to stretch time  you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes  to further lower my opinion  a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are  well  there aren t really that lot of them  because the characters are most men  there are at least one woman unisol though   but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once  the female leads get by with this  but we also pass through a strip club  to use a computer no less  with much more undressed women  these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent minded male audience so  in conclusion  boring fights  no more  no less  well  maybe less',-1

'i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it  the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony  they fly to the moon in a space age dustbin carrier  when there  they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase it strikes me that rubbish low budget sci fi films often involve either desert planets or  like this movie  criminals escaping from penal colonies  why this is i have no idea  but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical  this one is really no exception  it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half way alright dance music soundtrack  it then degenerates into a boring sci fi thriller  so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review  so if you re reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film s subtleties and nuances  for the record  i recall a tedious bunch of baddies  a tedious bunch of goodies  some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman  other than that  i m struggling if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film  i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets',-1

'i ll be honest  the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it s in the imdb bottom      and right now  i m wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another  check  on that same list van damme is luc deveraux  who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a  hal  to defend itself  and yes  after all the obligate explosions  shoot outs and chases he is the last one standing  combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set up it makes sure it s place in the infamous list is just only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list',-1

'i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn t make it to the end credits  first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest  second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting  lame sfx and extremely poor direction  pales in comparison to the original anyone ever hear about the old et atari      fiasco  for those who haven t let me fill you in  it s        et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time   atari decides to release a movie tie in game on their      home console system  to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari      et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn t even give them away let alone sell them what does universal soldier  the return have to do with this story  look at the     rating and figure it out for yourself awful film   imdb forced me to give it a   out of    because their rating systems doesn t go as low as   let alone into the negatives',-1

'this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world  i m pretty sure it was double team  which convinced everyone that jean claude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks  however it was this that tarnished his credibility forever  while universal soldier the return isn t as dull as double team or the quest it s still pretty awful indeed  with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing  this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling  as i look back  not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud  in other words another clunker in van damme s assembly line   out of   bad',-1

'this was an atrocious waste of my time  no plot  the acting was so far below par  it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do  it is merely a commercial rip off of the earlier universal soldier  which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel  its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years  and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it  this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name  by comparison  it makes segall  norris  and arnold look almost talented perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send ups of his genre  at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him',-1

'after seeing the low budget shittier versions of the  universal soldier  franchise  i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie  well  it seemed this prayer was answered  but not the way i hoped  universial soldier   is just intense as poetry reading at your local library  no  even that would be more intriguing   the fight sequences are top notch  bruce lee quality  which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture  that and having former wcw tough guy legend  goldberg  playing the villain  however  placing goldberg as seth s sidekick lieutenant would ve been better we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself  it s like some film school students slapped it together  the plot holes are that bigger than kanye west s ego is what really did this movie in  for example  luc s daughter  hillary looks like she s at least       years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago  how is that possible  tell me that  the part in which luc s partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just re goddamn diculous  you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie  c mon  the director could ve spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut  but oooh nooo speaking of the plot  it sucks  compared to the first movie  universal soldier   s plot watered down and worthless  where s the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an re enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something   this was the dawn of the millennium  you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia orwellian type of future cesspit  corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad  sad  sad sequel from what i seen  double impact  under siege    robocop    and hell  even the cheap ass no class terminator knock off  class of       is more entertaining than this',-1

'jean claude van damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of universal soldier  but  did that movie saved him  i think he goes to hell  after he dies in the first minute  we see the inside of a facility  where you can see the bad guy of the film  scary  huh  but not as scary as the acting  details are following  then  we see van damme with a black girl  do not remember the name    well it doesn t matter anyway   trying to escape from some muscle men  of course they are the new universal soldiers  more muscels  less brain  just like the movie   after a while  van damme fights goldberg but then the  mission  gets aborted  it was just a test  is this movie a test for our nerves    it turns out that van damme works for the government on the new universal soldier project  who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing  that yould van dammes character could do   but it is a sequel  and a  story  has to come up  ah  i forgot  he has a daughter  very important for the  story  well  after about    minutes  a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project  of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone  van damme escapes from the facility but the computer sends some soldiers hunting him  it wants van damme as a soldier   because he is the best  really     and guess what  goldberg is one of the hunters  who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked  funny  yes  just like the rest of the film after some  story   van damme tries to rescue his daughter  of his wife   the reporter in the first movie   it comes to a final show down where van damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie  please see for yourself  it is just too funny to tell  you ll see that this movie is a waste of time so do not watch it  but if you do  keep a sixpack with you',-1

'i don t think any movie of van damme s will ever beat universal soldier but u never know  this movie was good but not as good as  st  vd returns a luc   must do battle again  he tries   b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle  vd has a kid this time from ally w   good it showed a pic of them    goldberg was cool  he does his famous move forgot what its called cause i don t watch wrestling sucks  vd   goldberg had some good fights  it was the ending like the  st but just not that good  vd does his best move in his career  like always the helicopter kick  even though  the final ending should ve been longer  anyway  it is worth seeing but it will never top the original',-1

'the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel  since the real star  dolph lundgren  would not be able to reprise his role from the original  there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write off  bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white  to their credit  they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement  bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film  and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role  for once  his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times  and it does not get irritating  the problem from the audience s point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films  and therein lies the problem  you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action  you go because you want comedy  however unintentional unbeknownst to many people  universal soldier was followed by two direct to video sequels  i have only seen the first  which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke  matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career  the sight of jean claude van damme comes as a welcome relief  the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct to video sequels  and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original  after years of investigation and explanation  the unisol project is still going ahead  with some minor modifications  for one  the new unisols are stronger and more damage resistant than their earlier cousins  for another  all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth  in the early parts of the film  seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes  we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut  the unisol project is on the chopping block  which essentially means that seth will be turned off  seth  somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained  decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down  his only problem is that every so often  a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown  two individuals possess the code in question  seth kills the first in short order  and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme s films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be  the rest of the film revolves around the unisols  attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly  a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film  but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichs  when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white  we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over  he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity s weakness es   gee  seth  you mean they will not be our strong points  all kidding aside  the short length of the film is both the film s weakness and its strength  it leaves the action without adequate setup  in the original  we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols  how they work  and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film  here  the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate  at least in the original  a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice  here  one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform  and presumably his body   getting up every time without stopping for breath i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner  if you can see it on the cheap  knock yourself out  this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre',-1

'terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever  and as for the feminist polemic  it s laughable  i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief i m glad i did go to see it  that s because i now have an immediate answer to the question  what s the worst film you ve ever seen   plus  i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson  but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world  as is revealed in the closing credits  i only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film  all it took was a bunch of frilly costumes  a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady  and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public  so why shouldn t she think she could get away with the self indulgent nothingness that is the tango lesson',-1

'this is the worst movie i have ever seen  and i have seen quite a few movies  it is passed off as an art film  but it is really a piece of trash  it s one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing  but that cannot make up for sally potter s disgustingly obvious tribute to herself  the plot of this movie is nonexistent  and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end  especially where she starts singing  it s absolutely unreal',-1

'strange how less than   hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat  uninspiring drivel  if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter  wouldn t you expect a little passion to show through in her performance  her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and pablo and the tango scenes  which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance  were instead awkward and painful to watch  obviously  revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting  and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness',-1

'dire  just dire  the script is contrived  the acting painful  and the story just drags along  it is  without a doubt  a celebration of sally potter and little else  this wouldn t be so bad  but she s the director  writer and star of the film  and so is just self glorification  i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters  and the ending came not a moment too soon  it has two redeeming features  first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely  particularly in paris  and look rather good in black and white  secondly  whether you re a fan of tango or not  the music is by and large  excellent  except where sally starts singing   watch this film at your own risk  or if you need an unintentional laugh  i am sure it appeals to someone  statistically  it has to',-1

'probably encouraged by admirers of her much better  orlando   potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way  she writes  directs  stars  and actually co writes the music  including a mawkish love song  the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her  but potter s character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable  and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango  perhaps if she hadn t cast herself it might have worked  she just can t act  whether playing herself or not  pretentious  over ambitious  dull  and silly',-1

'the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims  on the surface  it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface  what lies is a not so positive message about rape  aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman  she needs a man to help her  when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her  she does not stand up for herself  it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying the director  satish kaushik  went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive  what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way  the director is famous for being chauvinistic  his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles  he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial  it does not mean that the character herself is strong the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya  cleans  herself after just being raped  she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty  though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light  what he does not show us is whether ash s father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing  thus we are left with a confusing message about rape the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this  even more so  the comedy is simply not funny  ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout  the music is mediocre except for the title track  which is beautifully picturised  the only bright point of this film   sonali bendre s role is disappointing and pointless  overall  what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion',-1

'but a lousy film  as maltin says this was christopher lee s attempt to make a serious horror film  well  it is serious   too serious  the plot is silly and slow  something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality    the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again  i actually dozed off a few times  the film is sooooo dull  the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee   but this was probably a labor of love for both  they often complained about horror movies being too violent   well  this has no violence    avoid at all costs   unless you have insomnia   this will put you to sleep',-1

'this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn t there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo    went through the van allan radiation belts they spent    min s there not the    min s claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray seriously do some research learn what really happened don t let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened',-1

'i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings              or not old enough to appreciate them  i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it i was a youngster at the time of apollo  but i was old enough to understand what was going on  the entire world followed the moon landings  our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch  newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings on each day  from launch to landing  from moonwalks to moon liftoff  all the way to splashdown  in a multitude of languages  in school  some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv  during apollo    the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate  you couldn t go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was  the world was truly one community now with a buffer of    odd years after the fact  it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down  we are left with our history books  and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to  prove  it with a bunch of lies and made up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise  not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days',-1

'this so called  documentary  tries to tell that usa faked the moon landing  year right all those who have actually studied the case knows different first of all  there is definitely proof  when the astronauts was on the moon  they brought back many pounds of rock from the moon   for geological studies  these where spread around the world to hundreds of labs  who tested them  and they all concluded that they came from the same planet  not earth  because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth  but similar to those calculated to be on the moon  i e  the conspiracy theorists never studies anything  they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing  i e  the flag moves  there is a logical explanation  the astronaut moved it with his hand  so it moved  and what proves this  well  if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage  they would see that the flag never moves after the astronaut have let it be  i e  the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists  they cant study a subject properly  or only studies it until they have what they came for  so that they can make a lie from that  and make a profit  i e  this so called  documentary   a claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places  because there are different light sources  the artificial lighting from the studio  once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong  as usual   the same would happen in an earth desert at night  with no light sources  but i doubt that any conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a star treck convention is held over the conspiracy theorists are in denial  big time  they only see what they want to see  so they make up all these lies to seem important   that is a fact',-1

'the only reason i didn t score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film  it is a technically adept film that having been said  this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven  most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program  rather than actual fact  and sibrel s  irrefutable proof  that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics i do not recommend watching this  but if you do  see it at google video for free  don t let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity',-1

'when i was    i saw the documentary   a funny thing happened on the way to the moon   i actually liked  and believed in it for a couple of years  but then i grew up  and began to think  and when i had sought more information  this is  more info from reel sources  and non biased sources  when i started at university  not so long ago  i asked an assistant professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories  what he said shocked me  he said that all those theories where lies  that baffled me  i did not believe it first  but then he presented evidence for his claims  he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject   humans did not go to the moon   the most outrages claim was that the apollo craft could not travel through the van allen radiation belt  without the crew perishing from radiation  the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy  it is not that well known  and the exact specifications are a secret  and why is it a secret  well  why should they reveal it back then   if they where in a space race with the russians  then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation and then there is the biggest evidence of all  the moon stones  when the apollo missions did go to the moon  they brought back many rocks from the moon  to give to geologists and similar scientists  who are documenting all things about the moon  these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon  because  the internal basic elements  which all matter consist of  are also made of special isotopes  that are different from quarry to quarry  land to land  and especially planet from planet  the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved  that they do not come from earth  the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilogram s of these rocks  all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth  and from the same planet  ergo  the moon landings where not fake  nasa did go to another planet  the moon  though it is not a planet  but a satellite to a planet  a moon  duuh   these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world  it has been proved  humans did go to the moon   it is a fact  pronto but i do not worry  most conspiracy theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated  that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts  the fact remains  humans did walk on the moon',-1

'the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo     and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the  whole earth  picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa  though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map  and the ones in private hands would still be a problem ah  a response   trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i d say is a charming  but weak and gullible argument  what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie  a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels  do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here      this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u s  government that the moon missions were a success  and that man now are true masters of the universe  things are nearly never quite what they seem   just watch the movie  and i dear say you ll see things a bit different than before  first off  weather data doesn t come from nasa  it comes for met agencies around the world  second  the weather data undermines a major claim in the film  third  far from being  packed with irrefutable evidence   the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked  sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film  so he edited it and added his own interpretation  unfortunately for him  his source film is public domain  and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims',-1

'there are so many incorrect statements in this so called  documentary  that i found myself shouting at the television bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd  but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims he relies on either being inaccurate  not telling the full story  or the old favourite  government always lies to us  innuendos  and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims what s more  his  exclusive  or  unreleased  footage is freely available over the internet from various sites further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews  and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions all of the claims made by mr sibrel about  inaccuracies    mistakes   or  whistleblowing  in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven how do i get that    odd minutes of my life back',-1

'i watched this video at a friend s house  i m glad i did not waste money buying this one  the video cover has a scene from the      movie capricorn one  the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow ups  most not related to manned flight  sibrel s smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast  he edits in his own voice over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say  the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film  his claims about radiation  shielding  star photography  and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa  the astronauts  or american in general  his science is bad  and so is this video',-1

'writer director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa  he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks  the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time  and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film unfortunately sibrel s research is so slipshod that he doesn t realize his  backstage  footage is really taken in large part from the    minute live telecast  also on that reel  that was seen by millions  not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies  and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts  audio in the footage  because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera  not faking footage finally  anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel s hacked up version of it   he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk s assassination than of his  smoking gun    sibrel thinks he s the only one who s seen it  what s more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use  such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth  destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth as with most films of this type  sibrel relies on innuendo  inexpert assumption  misleading commentary  and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence',-1

'the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller  looking surprisingly aged a year after  tarzan and the huntress   is bad  in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better  it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller  shooting in beautiful scenery in mxico  with a top star of that country  andrea palma  and multiple award winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa  and bringing in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score  although it may have cost less for filming abroad  it looks more expensive than any other rko film in the series  taking advantage of acapulco beaches and real pyramids as aquatania  and with impressive dcors for all the scenes related to the temple of god balu  especially the exterior  built on steep rocks   kurt neumann should have stayed as director  instead of robert florey  who gives it a very slow pace  neumann had done a fine work with  tarzan and the amazons    tarzan and the leopard woman  and  tarzan and the huntress   and finished his career directing the classic  the fly  the year before his death  while florey became a television director  after a career of few remarkable films  if weissmuller looks tired  the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the others  but the worst character is benji  an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs  that have a caribbean air  in a location supposed to be africa and shot in mxico   boring and decidedly of dubious taste  it was a sad farewell to weissmuller s tarzan',-1

'be warned  this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways each story has only a few minutes  so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot  just an sketchy idea of a plot  the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer  however  that just didn t work out because you didn t get to know the characters in before or these  jokes  were just silly this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart  a dozen times  or even more  i don t know and i don t care',-1

'some guy gets whacked  right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him  he s got some bodyguards and they whack the killer  but a reporter gets interested  she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked  she walks in  and corners one bodyguard  but he doesn t feel like talking  i can t figure out why  it s not like anyone else is interested  she s the only reporter there  anyway  her editor discourages her from working on this lame story  but hey  she does anyway  she goes to see the killer s sister   mom  a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time   somebody blows up their trailer   huge ball of fire  then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital  she finds him hungover on his boat  but a minute later they re both underwater sucking on a scuba tank  cause three guys are trying to whack them  and have blown up the boat big time   huge ball of fire   the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street  there s a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse  some car chases with wreckage   death  a fake suicide  etc  etc  lotsa stiffs  all kindsa carnage great stuff  but what the reporter and the bodyguard can t figure is  why in hell the original guy got whacked  what s the motivation  of course  it might help us to figure out why the reporter s even interested  through almost all of this she s the only reporter on the story  nobody else in the media cares  not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies  true  the original guy who got whacked wasn t exactly a celebrity  his job was a little bit dull  he was just the president  yeah  the one who lives in the white house  oh  and the bodyguard is a secret service agent is that the spoiler it should be  after all there are no tv cameras  no other print reporters  no bloggers    just another one of those police blotter crimes   so what s the spoiler lemme think   no  wait  the spoiler is that his wife did it  yeah    the first lady  she was p   ed because the president was fooling around  and she gets away with it  she s really sharp  huh  but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out  why would anyone bother  after all  only one reporter is even interested i give this move a      it was so dumb i just had to keep watching  and it only got dumber  that s the real spoiler  but even though i ve told you  you ve got to see it to believe it',-1

'please  help the economy   spend your money elsewhere  the synopsis of the movie is  the first lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her  that s it  undetected by anyone  except cuba and angie  she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about   and gets away completely free some specific points are particularly hilarious  while standing in front of the president  cuba a deflects the assassin s bullet   which then enters the back of the president s head cuba and angie watch film from a news camera  and they see   a clue  they go to great lengths to protect the film  believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film cuba speaks with a presidential staff member  the psm comments that there was no conspiracy  cuba claims there was more than one person involved  the psm then rants that the conspiracy includes the fbi  the cia  and the nsa  gosh  i wonder is the psm is involved ms archer  the first lady  is a craptacular artist  cuba can t make out a painting  and she says   you re too close   stand back   look from a different perspective  look from my perspective   can anyone miss that clue',-1

'end game started well  the least said about the end the better  it seemed like things we re happening just to keep the plot going  for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive  intelligent person  half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character  we are given no reason for this apart from  the next scene wouldn t make sense without it  the whole story could have been told in about    minutes  it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr  is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering the end game was honestly one of the worst films i ve ever seen      and that s saying something  i ve seen gigli',-1

'i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought  with all the good actors in it  would be worth watching  i couldn t believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened     i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else    i tried to figure it all out  but really had no clue  thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it    right or wrong  it s better than not knowing anything   who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away  how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her  at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth  does this mean that we re going to be subjected to end game',-1

'my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory  however  of the    pages of reviews  only a handful are negative  i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future i admit  i m more inspired to write reviews when i don t like a movie than as to when i do  so my handful of reviews are all negative  still  that doesn t mean i m biased towards not enjoying a movie  but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoy paris je t aime is the most pretentious movie i ve seen in years  by using an  intelligent  concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories  the movie ends up the worst of all worlds  it is art for arts sake  but something that a   year old could dream up and accomplish  giving the director free reign of   minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment  directors can t write  writers can t direct   i d like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated  but that is because he s an actor turn director  which rarely works  either   what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that don t make any sense  are not completed in   minutes and in total  spoil paris to me  why call it paris je t aime when a more apropos title is cluster f ck  there are only a couple stories that are watchable  most notably the piece by alfonso cuarn  but everything else will fall into obscurity  the coen brothers short is passable  but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar  it s as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it  as we all love paris  present company included  we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks  in fact  i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their   minutes  seriously  seriously people  natalie portman is not a good actress  she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours  and maggie gyllenhaal  why    are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies  i m looking at you natalie portman  garden state  closer   elijah wood  sin city  and catalina sandino moreno  maria full of grace  one final comment on the acting  i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again  find his short on youtube as his   minutes are quite enjoyable writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right  i m thinking of ernst hemingway  raymond carver  f  scott fitzgerald  and john cheever  just to name a few  it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this  the same can be said about short films  it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story  then don t expect to enjoy this movie at all  the directors either didn t care or were lazy  in either scenario  by the time you are reading this it means you rented it  praise be that you didn t pay    dollars a head in theaters for it',-1

'i guess its possible that i ve seen worse movies  but this one is a real stinker  the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it  the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching  he s capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together angie harmon  playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who s behind the assassination of the president  truly butchered the role  there was no chemistry with gooding  her demeanor was flat and wooden  and the   inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd  this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the  b  list and what was cuba gooding thinking    he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances  but this was far beneath what we ve come to expect from him poor james woods and burt reynolds  poor poor poor poor poor',-1

'as much as i dislike saying  me too  in response to other comments   it s completely true that the first    minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following    having been banned somewhere doesn t make a film watchable  just because it doesn t resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible worse yet  in addition to no discernible plot  other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people  even very old women  drink lots of vodka  a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i m in to my second package of rolaids as for spoilers   well  the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn t write one if i tried don t waste your time or money  and don t confuse this with good russian cinema',-1

'i agree with the previous comment  the beginning of the movie is quite good  and get s you wandering about what is to come        which is nothing  all open story lines remain open  two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture  save for   or   very short scenes  i wander if ilya wouldn t have done better to just completely leave them out     as for the one remaining character  nothing is done with her either  she just visits some god awful place  and suddenly the movie isn t about her anymore  but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread  drinking homemade vodka  and apparently flashing each other  some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling  like the judges of the iffr  but for me it is just bad taste  bad camera work  a lousy script and frightfully bad direction  therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading',-1

'the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute s return to her home village for the funeral of a sister friend  there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken  but they are not fully explored  the core of the movie is the funeral  wake  and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable  apparently  the movie is unedited  the prostitute s journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud  maybe that s supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape  the village itself  such as it is  is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male  the consort of the dead girl  continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible  most of the film is shot with a hand held camera that could induce nausea  another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don t include the songs and laments of the crones  don t go to this movie unless you re fluent in russian',-1

'the movie starts quite with an intriguing scene  three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar  all of them are making up a bit outrageous stories  as the movie unfolds  it turns out that the most outrageous story is true  however  beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed  this revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly  not much is left to be seen  the rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies  sure  these are fascinating and a bit shocking images  but admiring them goes on way too long  sacrificing any possible plot or character development  i found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie making  where instead of trying to make an interesting story  movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories  case in point   meat trader s story  to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends  on a surface it has artsy appearance  but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent',-1

'i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago what a disaster  the acting was atrocious there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn t ring true supposedly a modern reworking of the hitchcock original  lifeboat  i think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it from what i was able to suffer through there is nothing compelling in this movie it boasts a few semi big names but they put no effort into their characters but you know to be fair it was nobody s fault really i mean i m pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion  lol it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along but for me i m not willing to spend at least three days to find out so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon avoid this stinker',-1

'this film is really bad  with a script full of  memorable  lines and incredibly bad performances  the special effects are also bad  not the worst ones i have seen  either  and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it  just two short themes     seconds long or so  are repeated constantly throughout the whole film all in all  one of the worst films i have ever seen',-1

'why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance  i want a refund    can i have my     back  while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen  nothing did happen  the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot  which was not really like the film  why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out  it was not very artistic  why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes  why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading  or was that the point  i felt like phantom love had no story at all  and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film',-1

'this film was so disappointing  from the blurb that made me decide to see phantom love  why is it called this  i had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery  it did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense  in fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time  in the end the effect was listless i believe the film was meant to be atmospheric  but it just wasn t  the lack of a coherent plot did not help matters  you might say it was mysterious  but i think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere the main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation  without looking at the cast list i would not have known that you see the main character as a child  the film has very little context for the time  place or character  i am not a prude but the sex scenes  there were several  seemed pointless and confused me further  i recognised lulu but i was not sure if it was the same man  different men  a lover  her husband or was she a prostitute  it was only when i saw the credits that i discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover  this film did manage to make what should have been shocking  dream sequences involving lulu s mother  seem a bit boring the nail filing actually made more sense  as it did give some indication of lulu s emotional state  i will not fault the actors as i don t they had a lot to work on i do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull i can t be bothered talking about it anymore',-1

'del    you are the dumbest smart person i ve ever met  calvin   well i had a brain  but they lost it in the re writes  i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov s work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed  in the books  she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists  able to think her way through a problem  here she s just a damsel in distress  waiting to be rescued by wil smith there are passing references to asimov s laws of robotics  but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes smith is likable  as he is in most of his films  but honestly  the story isn t that good  you figure it out long before these genius characters do',-1

'i can t really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction  forget the product placement disaster  the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plot holes  this wasn t only laughable and but painful to watch  even the action was boring  a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children what a shame that sci fi this bad can still be made after we ve had bladerunner  minority report or to a lesser extent dark city  by the same director   this one really belongs in the bottom     list  truly awful',-1

'after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie goers  there are the ones who are well read  extremely literate  and intelligent  they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author  for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature  considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre pubescent teenagers  today s well read fan knows well this history  and knows the great authors asimov  heinlein  bradbury  and ellison  who helped bring science fiction out of that basement  in doing so they created thought provoking  intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition  this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them  they are not critical for it s own sake  but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye   as they should as hollywood s record has been less than stellar   to these fans the story must take supreme importance  they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics  and non stop action sequences  when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest the second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre   look at many of the above comments that state  well i haven t read the book or anything by this author     their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel  they are extremely uncritical  willing to overlook huge plot holes  weak premises  and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects  they are  in effect  willing to turn off their critical thinking skills  or maybe they never had them   for the duration of the movie  case in point  i robot  while supposedly based on asimov s short stories and named after one of his novels  it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations   those of you that will run out and buy i  robot will be very much surprised this movie isn t even based on that story at all  the film has enormous plot holes  that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity  i won t point them out  i won t spoon feed you  you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself  the characters  which are named after many of asimov s characters  do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories  the plot itself with all it s action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for  his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds  not their fists  is vital to understanding his vision of the future  in short  other than the name  their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie  there will always be those uncritical  i e  unthinking  who will state   the movie doesn t have to be like the book  due to the medium  movies sometimes require that changes be made   but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book  or books  from the start  what if all they took from the written work was the title  this begs the question  why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it s title on your vacuous piece of crap  save money and don t buy the rights to the works  title it something else  don t use the character s names  believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism  in fact it won t matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him  but it will upset those who read  who think  who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show i  robot  like much of hollywood s take on the genre  pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago  hollywood could not do this alone  it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this',-1

'this is probably the most boring  worse and useless film i have seen last year  the plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix  with plenty of clichs  the lone wolf cop  good looking  psychologically disturbed  sleeping with his gun      nice hard worker and shy  but good looking she scientist  you add a   cent plot and you have i  robot  i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like fedex audi converse etc  this movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after    sec  i wouldn t recommend this to my worse enemy  if you have some spare time  watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book',-1

'the only thing remarkable about this movie  is that all the actors could bomb at the same time  idiocy  i want my money back   and i got it free from the library  sheesh  i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again',-1

'this  film  is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film  unnecessary slow motion  unnecessary flipping jumping somersaults  unnecessary characters  unnecessary dialogue     basically unnecessity   is that a word  well  it s just been invented by i  robot  what happened to practicality   i e  the car garage  the skin spray  the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop what happened to showing respect for women   i e  smith s character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film  and yet she still  wants  him  where is the tension  i ll tell you where  good looks and not admiration or common ground what happened to a detective that detects  smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself  complaining to other people  and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off  this is such a lame way to get the story from point b c d etc    it was ok once  but not several times in a row   speaking of several times in a row  what was the  i m snoring and not listening to you joke  twice in one scene  what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes  shia labeouf  the kid  is in the movie for a total of two scenes  we know that a he degrades women  and b he knows smith        so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm what happened to hero s  let s just forget that there are people  women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that i have an acquaintance with  and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air  showing off  while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot don t get me wrong  i m all for spectacle  but i m also all for a shred of realism and meaning i have to say i ve never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time  so thanks alex i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques  simpler stories and simpler everything else in films       but mainly simpler techniques big budget action films   you so have to die',-1

'this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store  don t make the same mistake i did  this movie is tedious  unconvincingly acted  and generally boring  the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered  i cringed at every scene they shared  dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self  his role was clearly not a stretch for him  and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico  it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot  all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo irish accents  odd  anyway  when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store  keep walking',-1

'a splendid example of how hollywood could  and still can  take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up in the case of  the big sky   writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prize winning author  a b  guthrie  in so doing  they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation the epic nature of guthrie s book and the evolution of its main character  boone caudill  from a naive  kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor mountain man  has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author s intent  in the movie version  boone s presence is nothing except underwhelming intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthrie s novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever  most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character  who was an incidental  minor character in the book  only occupying a handful of pages  on the other hand  a very important and fascinating character  dick summers  the veteran pioneer  is missing altogether    it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie  played by actor hunnicutt  wasn t irritating enough  so zeb hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious  voice over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing  editing  and direction some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based  william wyler s  ben hur  is an excellent example   but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself the story is dull and clichd  and the characters   at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script   are just shallow and boring shadows of guthrie s literary vision  and unfortunately  kirk douglas  star appeal  which could have helped lift this film  was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given if you can believe it  the film version of guthrie s pulitzer prize winning sequel   the way west   also starring kirk  is even worse in my opinion   the big sky  further solidifies howard hawks  place as one of the most overrated  tepid directors in the history of cinema',-1

'not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc  but easily the worst  never seeing the light of day  the director is not even canadian  but british  and boy does it show  we are all made out to be a bunch of over sexed dope fiends and morons  the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent  and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk  of course the british character is normal  the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype   can you say  norm     the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes  the actors always seem to be fidgetting  are they as bored as the viewer  or is this the directors idea of cinema  avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films  a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically  you won t be compelled to walk out on his films after    minutes',-1

'this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine  moronic idiots  the men get stoned drunk  and then they yell beat each other up in almost every scene  the women are superfluous to the story  i do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus  or worse  milling around like mesmerized cattle  apparently  canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks  it s the standard knocked up girlfriend  her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before every character here is a carping  infantile stereotype  not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower  and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag  i watched the movie because samuel west was in it  but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this  maybe he needed the money  ian tracey is a superb actor   the only one with a vague redeeming moment  but his talent is wasted here as for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn   or karl  who is dead  but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind  almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock s masterpiece  although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films   why even bother  karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying by the end of this wretched movie  i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat',-1

'i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored  how can people possibly give this a     it s not just that it s supposed to be a feel good redemption film  i think   because it doesn t work on that level either  weak plot  bad dialogue  terrible acting  there s just nothing there  harvey keitel is decent  but has nothing to work with  and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible  the plot progression  especially the relationship between byron and ashley  makes no sense  it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it  without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow  it s only an hour and a half  but that s    minutes of your life you ll never get back',-1

'this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen  branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn t deliver his lines  the plot was definitely not worthy of john grisham s name  no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters  i didn t even watch the whole thing  i decided i didn t care who done it  then realized there was no  whodunit  to care about',-1

'might contain possible spoilers  not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion  sure it s cheaper for them  but after a while  wouldn t you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off  house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all  some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are  the voices don t even remotely match up and iago is evil again  since when    i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films  even the movie s musical number  which had been disney s specialty for years  stunk  i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone even the very young  all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released  it s only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality',-1

'the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it the crazy filmdirector the rest of the movie was just boring in the first hour or so nothing really happens jokes which supposed to be funny aren t and zeta jones douglas is really overacting julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck  yeah right   into the girl next door  where did i see this before   who gets the guy for short i really didn t care what would happen with the main characters if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch',-1

'and i mean ultra light  this film features four giant stars  about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that there really isn t too much to say about this stinker  other than that although it has a couple of really good bits  most of it isn t very funny  nor does it work at all as a romance  how about as a romantic comedy  not on your life  most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated  much less amusing what s really ashame is the premise is not bad at all  this movie could have been so much more  especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted  complete with phony quotes from critics  the film uncovers the un mined territory of the press junket    those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews  but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes  it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film s lame romance the same with catherine zeta jones  character    the whinny  self centered movie star  zeta jones does a good job with what she s given  but she s given practically nothing  it s all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we ve heard about stars over the years in the end  it is hard to understand what made zeta jones  julia roberts  john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship  which sinks like a rerun of  the love boat   in fact  as the old joke goes  they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal  it would probably make a better story  so  go ahead and tell us  filmmakers  what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this',-1

'would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball  this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level  in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp  he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra  this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world  the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it',-1

'this film proves that the  commercial  cinema  or else the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille s name there is no worth referring to the plot  it is a bit more perplexed than a knot what else the screen is somewhat dim o neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse rating',-1

'yes  kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies  but with humanity  here we have shaq as a rapping genie  yes  a rapping genie  where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits  all ending in him in a christ like pose with lots of light surrounding him  so  yeah  expect really cheesy bits  including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky  and  regrettably  not knocking out the two main characters  particularly the kid   what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and shaquille o neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy  the main plot of the film involves this kid  played in that all too typical and annoying kid fashion by the great grandson of frank capra  where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily   who comes upon a genie who s been trapped in a boom box  then  hiarity ensues  as the kid makes the shaq genie his quasi slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady gang type absentee father this really sappy  contrived son and father story would be bad enough  as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies  i e  the  two chances in life  speech from father to son   but it s shaquille o neill who is both the reason to watch the film  ironically   and the obvious sinking crux of it all  his plot line involves him  when not getting the over talky treatment from capra  to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career  on top of this  he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom box  so is there a camp factor to the movie  up to a point  but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and  heart felt  moments that have really no business with the rest of the material  one might ask if the people making the movie  who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting bandwagon  if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing  i d hope that they too knew they were just getting paid  but i d hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the shaq machine so  if you want to have a fun night of shaq as genie turned rapper turned wisecracker  all the more fun to you  hell  it might even be interesting to have a shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort steel  but if you re hoping to keep a few brain cells  stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of       and a candidate among many others for worst of the    s',-1

'this movie is so  so  so horrible  that it makes angels lose their wings  shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts  like his work in shaq fu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums  and later  the epic serving of horrible film making that is steel there s not a single good thing to be said about this movie  i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young  but i must ve been an idiot then  because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart  it s fun to mock  i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that  although  once the thrill of mocking it is done  you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness if you see it on tv  try this  consider  as your watching the film  removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers  if you do that  it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him  that s kinda funny  and disturbing a horrible example of film  do not  unless looking to mock it  see this movie',-1

'what was the point of this movie  what was the plot  i do not know  shaq can t act  people don t know how to direct  and i am kazaam  a genie who raps  come on  maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this  i remember i watched this just to kill time  it didn t really interest me  i just remember thinking   who put shaq in this movie     the whole story seemed stupid too  it made no sense whatsoever  i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen  i can t comment much more because this movie is so terrible there s nothing worth commenting about  i  wish  this movie would go away',-1

'now  i m one to watch movies that got poor reviews  and say   hmm    this isn t so bad   i loved the cable guy  and thought that my big fat independent movie was great  keep in mind  i really didn t start watching this with high hopes  but i figured that maybe    just maybe    it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it  i was wrong  at no point at all during my suffering through this  film   and i use that term sparingly  was i even close to being mildly entertained  to start  shaq makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting  i hate rap music  but as far as i could tell  an amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him  the main character is simply annoying  and not a character that it s easy to like  quite frankly  i would rather eat a greasy turd out of a harlequin fetus  bloody sores than watch this again',-1

'let me give a quick summery of the film  a rotten  rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains kazaam  a rapping genie  like all genies  he grants   wishes but  being good natured  also helps max with his personal life  as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime  during all this  kazaam raps from time to time   also showcasing shaq s dismal rap skills  this movie proves what we all know  athletes need to stick to sports  i admit that it never looked like an oscar worthy movie  but everything about this waste of film is horrible  the characters are either unlikable or stupid  the plot is not even worth mentioning  the dialog is a joke  and shaq is only a quarter of the problem  hell  even if denzel washington played kazaam this movie would still be a joke  i know that the movie only drew anybody was because shaq was so big  no pun intended  at the time  i honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time  shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws',-1

'reviewing kazaam and saying it s a bad movie isn t hard at all  after all  critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film  saying it was among the worst films of the decade  so the fact that i say it s bad or anyone else says it s bad is certainly no surprise  it s like someone talking about wwii  practically no one says that was a good thing  right   the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is  why did they make this in the first place     after all  it s obvious to anyone who isn t severely brain injured that the film would be horrible  but  movies like ed  a baseball playing chimp   cool as ice  starring the ever popular vanilla ice   troll    which doesn t even have any trolls in it   baby geniuses  einstain like superhero babies  and pinocchio in outer space  huh     prove that any idea  no matter how dumb  can make it to the big screen  so  the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright  normal  the film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school  like the punk from free willy  this kid is somehow  misunderstood   in other words  a total brat  and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is  by the end of the film he ll have learned something and grown  just once  i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film  eventually  while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him  the genie kazaam  shaquille o neal is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes  but  the kid doesn t believe him and the genie s magic seems a tad rusty eventually the brat does realize that kazaam is for real  however  unlike most kids  he withholds making his wishes so  in the meantime  kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere  like his own personal servant  and  according to the clich  you know that by the end of the film  max and kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed  oh  and max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom s fianc  i m gonna gag   apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes as for kazaam  shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap   very poorly  i m a middle aged white guy and i think i could probably rap at least as well  he s an amazing basketball player and i ve heard he s a nice guy  but a rapper   no way  as far as his acting goes  he wasn t great but had such a nice personality in the film that it s hard to hate him  even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things so is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you ve probably heard  through the first two thirds of the movie  i would have said no  shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script  however  later in the film  the bad becomes horrid  as kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he s really needed  and  out of nowhere  the plot gets really  really weird  as the guy who wants to make kazaam a rap star       turns out to be an evil mobster  and  oddly  this guy seems to accept that kazaam is a genie with no hesitation in addition  the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill max and his dad  i know that the kid was annoying  but this is supposed to be a kids  film   what part of  trying to kill the kid  didn t the writers not understand    then  in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history  kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug induced hallucination  this ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in the black hole   and boy  did it make my brain hurt   uggghh  the horrible dialog was just too much to bear   overall  it s a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane  yes  folks  with a messed up message  bizarre non kid friendly material and horrible characters  this is one wretched film  sadly  given the idea and actors  it s hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse  by the way  if you want to see a genie in a modern world film that is good  try the british made for tv film  bernard and the genie   a charming and exceptionally well written film from start to finish',-1

'the only reason i dvrd this movie was because    i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and    i ve always heard how awful it was  the movie did not disappoint  the best parts were shaq s outfits  the worst parts were  well  just about everything else  my    year old son and i just squirmed and couldn t look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn t wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his  but for all it s terribleness we just couldn t stop watching it  the story sucked you in  like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit  it was hypnotic  but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched  kazzam',-1

'if you are a fan of really bad movies  and you think there funny  you will the great acting of shaq  first off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works  shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to dennis rodman who also made a few bad movies  well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid  i would give this a zero but that is impossible',-1

'this movie has successfully proved what we all already know  that professional basket ball players suck at everything besides playing basket ball  especially rapping and acting  i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is  first of all  is it just me  or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen  i mean  his teeth could be used as a can opener  secondly  why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when  even though he has magical powers  he sucks horribly at making music  third  i have read the bible  in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies  fourth  what was the deal with all the crappy special effects  i assure you that any acne addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that  fifth  why did the ending suck so badly  and what the hell is a djin  and finally  whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower  because this movie take the word  suck  to an entirely new level',-1

'i was given the book version of kazaam for my  th birthday  and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie  but this time they were wrong  at least with the movie it s over soon the acting in this is terrible  which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster  which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there   the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor  he s bullied by neighborhood kids  which i don t blame them because he s a little douche bag the story is just plain stupid and extremely clich  about a boy who s father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father even at   years old i thought this was a stupid idea  it s a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it s an embarrassment and should have never been made  i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks  but you should already know just by reading the plot',-1

'this is the worst film i have ever seen i was watching this film with some friends and after    minutes we had enough  the plot was bad and there wasn t a single likeable character i could get more entertainment watching static  i gave this movie a   only because the scale didn t go into negative numbers  avoid this movie at all costs',-1

'how a director of altman s experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with  or to care about what happens to  a lead character who is neurotic  a whiner  a jerk with no redeeming qualities    that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work  a monstrous piece of trash  in addition to this crippling flaw  the plot line requires serious concentration to follow  the setup that the branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience  this latter issue is at the core of the film  it represents directorial self indulgence with profound contempt for the taste  values  and intelligence of the viewer  very unusual for mr  altman patrick watson',-1

'there s only one thing i need to say about this movie   the scene where shaq is in a musical number with francis capra s character about wanting to be a genie  never see this movie  the story is horrible  the acting is terrible  c mon  it s shaq   and i d rather see capra in free willy  equally horrible  twice before ever seeing this movie',-1

'what a pathetic movie i won t waste much time commenting about it  i m still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it let me leave it simply with   shaq has no business being an actor or singer  he is utterly without talent at both discplines  it s a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no talent that is shaq',-1

'as a  jane eyre  fan i was excited when this movie came out   at last   i thought   someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author   wrong    if the casting director was intending to cast a  jane  who was plain he certainly succeeded  however  surely he could have found one who could also act  where was the tension between jane and rochester  where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere  where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother  finally  why was the plot changed at the end  one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book  what a disappointment',-1

'i love the book   jane eyre  and have seen many versions of it  all have their strong points and their faults  however  this was one of the worst i have seen  i didn t care about jane or mr  rochester  charlotte gainsbourg  jane  was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part  but she had no emotion in any of her lines  i couldn t imagine what mr  rochester saw in her that brings us to mr  rochester  william hurt had even less emotion than jane  if that were possible  how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery  but it certainly didn t hold my attention  perhaps the director  zeffrelli  fell asleep during the production the timothy dalton  too handsome for mr  rochester   version is far more faithful to the book  but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr  rochester in the      a e version  which is not all that true to the book  trying to find something positive about this movie  geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role',-1

'oh just what i needed another movie about   th century england  which is pretty much like regular england only nobody s vandalising football stadiums in this picturesque setting of lords dames and other randomly chosen titles charlotte gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane eyre from that novel nobody has ever read willingly jane usually hangs out in mr rochester s crib where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time one day mr rochester william hurt on auto pilot comes back to fall in love with jane and all that but there s still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic oops that wasn t in the brochure after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire they probably rented the set  the movie finally comes to an end everything looked really authentic that s something i guess but then again nah',-1

'having read the novel before seeing this film  i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot  i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of bronte s work  and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story  in the condensing of the film to a short  hours  the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional  thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding  there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre  so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their  love  is superficial  this is such an injustice to bronte s novel you are given no impression of jane s quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her  and his arrogance which attracts jane to him despite to poor scripting  i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely  namely mrs fairfax and grace poole  however overall the production was poor  given a better scripting  perhaps the film would have been more successful  see  jane eyre         with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production',-1

'what was franco zeffirelli thinking  was hollywood responsible for this travesty  or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didn t speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte bronte s classic  i don t think i can improve on a comment i read below  so i ll just paraphrase it   jane eyre is a great great book  the screenwriter should read it sometime   it s true that this movie s two leads were sadly miscast  but pity the actors  because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes  the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun   deleted from the script  the marriage proposal  the fortune teller   gone  the allusions  half joking  half sincerely felt  to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despair   eliminated it is unfortunate that zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane s interactions with the rivers family  but it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written do yourself a favor and go find the          mini series with timothy dalton',-1

'i read the novel  jane eyre  for the first time back in       it was round that time that i saw the bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke  it was an excellent version and very much like the book  years later  i laid eyes on this version and was horrified  william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester  mr rochester is a passionate character  where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice  the same goes for charlotte gainsborough  it was like watching two zombies together  this is story about love and passion  but i couldn t see it in this version  no  back to the bbc version  a wonderful time is guaranteed',-1

'jane eyre  is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it  i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about  this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book the whole  red room  is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in  in the book the  red room  is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane s life  helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i m sure she was happy to die and leave early  in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head  the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it',-1

'i don t like using the word  awful  to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time  effort  talent and money is spent in its creation but zefferelli s attempt to adapt charlotte bront s novel  jane eyre  is a total waste of time the script is lacking in finesse and power  everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms  leaving little to the imagination  the lead actors are woefully miscast  clearly hired for their star names  and the musical score drippy and dull  charlotte gainsbourg and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all  she is like a wet noodle  worse even than joan fontaine  who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion  and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy  of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick joan plowright s mrs fairfax is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out there is no mystery surrounding the story of rochester s first wife  the role of the would be second wife  played like a barbie doll by elle macphearson  is an empty cipher fiona shaw  a very great actress  is completely wasted as jane s aunt  mrs reed  she would have been better cast as mrs fairfax  only amanda root  as jane s beloved school teacher  evokes any authentic sympathy or believability i saw this version of  jane eyre  after viewing robert young s for british television  made in       starring ciaran hinds  samantha morgan and gemma jones  there is no comparison  young s vital  romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to zefferelli s wet squib i will be interested now to see the      version with timothy dalton  about which i ve read some very good things on this web site  i am amazed at how many people liked zefferelli s yorkshire picture book about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored  beyond that it is a complete dud',-1

'this version is pretty insipid  i m afraid  jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood  but william hurt s weary  throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored  petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt  i also can t believe that they eliminated edward s great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book  one of the most moving moments in literature  i do appreciate that they finally used such a young  plain woman to play jane  a character who is supposed to be a worldly     but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel  please see the    s version with george c  scott and susannah york  york was too old  tall and pretty to play jane  but no one has touched rochester s character the way that scott did',-1

'what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte bronte s brilliance of the original classic story  i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie  which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste  had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful  much of the witty back and forth between the main characters  jane eyre and mr  rochester  seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor  also missing was jane eyre s charismatic sense of self  which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all  the original jane eyre was a hero  the woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over  including one of the greatest parts of the story when jane runs away from thornfield and mr  rochester  her struggle to find food and shelter  her shame at having to beg for bread  the threat of freezing to death in the cold  all to get away from a man she loved were  in my opinion  poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie  the title character seemed dry and uninspired  the story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book  i cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting  the screenplay and direction did little if any credit to the classic story',-1

'i can t say this is the worst film of all time  but only because there are still some movies i haven t seen  yet  this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time  the director suffers from the same issues he had with  there will be blood   though he wasn t quite as bad in that film  the whole movie it feels like you re watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities  it s like he sits in his little director s chair and thinks  how would a great filmmaker handle this scene   he just doesn t have it in him  i don t know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker  there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished  but nothing was brought to ripen  the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history  one by one as we see the characters singing  and i squirmed in my seat  i kept saying  please  please  just don t have the guy on the brink of death singing  too   sure enough  massive failure',-1

'this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children s comic  i gave it   out of    for it s attention to detail because for the most part it had a   s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make up was good this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally   usually seen in one of their biographies  no interviews with surviving cast members  crew members  production team members etc   or their friends  families  and any biographers of those people  in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the  supposedly  biographical book  as for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and wasn t common knowledge well that never happened',-1

'this movie is like real life  by which i mean   not a lot happens in the available   hours or so  and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast  their invisibility being due to the  experimental  lighting as mentioned by many reviewers  a big bore  no big surprise that altman helms this   he is a very variable performer  yes we all loved  gosford park   but  pret a porter  anyone  kansas city  dr t  and the women  aaargh   but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale  and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber   makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film  and no  it is not  so bad it s good  it s just bad',-1

'it was everything this isn t  it had pace  pop  and actors who weren t afraid to chew the scenery  it also had a decent script  this one had me scratching my head  if farrah isn t really  serious  about a career  why does she have a manager  and why is he wasting his time   if kate and barney are  artists   why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows  like the  brady bunch  movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare  only to find himself on bb   they weren t industry names  but they weren t exactly starving  either  and while they got the history right  the poster was released before farrah got the show   silverman rejecting pitches for  funniest home videos  and  american idol  and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he ll create a show for her obviously did not happen what bothered me was how spelling s role is distorted  he s shown as the show runner and creator when he was neither  and how he  comes up  with the  idea  for ca was is laughable how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrah s oral contract when the others were signed  and why didn t farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva  but because majors wanted her to  this is why  when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the  bad girl   like suzanne somers   it fails because the groundwork was never laid    that was where the  three s company  pic delivered',-1

'this may have been made for the hell of it  but it was most probably the worst film i ve seen in years  the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case    i m surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too  i m glad i only rented  i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter  i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future  that is  if he is still in work notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing  don t buy it',-1

'sadly this is not  the best british gore film since hellraiser   though the dvd cover claims this  which is what tricked me into buying it  it is  however  an homage to many of the great horrors of old  films from most notably the amicus stable cradle    is shot on mini dv  which though we all know has more of a tv feel than a movie  can be done so much better  every scene  set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way  standard key  fill  rear setup   which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece  the gore content is  quite frankly  laughable  from the opening shots where we see a man s obviously foam rubber head torn apart  through to tacky cheap prop hammers  the creature effects and the terrible cg  there was nothing in there that impressed me at all the acting is abominable  from the near comatose detective to the brummie dwarf  via dani filth  the least convincing horror movie bad guy i have ever witnessed  each of the substories is more formulaic than the last  and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs  look out for the  mental asylum    a georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside  and the most bizarre  and not in a good way  padded cell i have seen it took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering  nay  running  away at any available opportunity  i actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running it does  however  mark one of the last known appearances of emily booth s breasts  which i guess is one  um  two  things it has going for it  once that s out of the way though  it is all downhill i ve heard people say good things about alex chandon  and i would love to believe them  but on this evidence i m not likely to  if you want a decent homage to amicus  avoid this and go for the league of gentlemen christmas special instead currently battling it out with blair witch    book of shadows for the title of worst film i have ever seen',-1

'not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half way through    but then with this one  i was only    minutes in when i considered  unfortunately  i did make it all the way through  make sure that you do not it s not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual  it s that it s not any of those things  yet it so desperately wants to be all of them  instead  it s boring  trite  ordinary  predictable  and unexceptionally poorly executed  shot on video  high school special effects  no sense of even basic visual storytelling  dialog barely audible   not that it s worth hearing  though  this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight to video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere',-1

'by all accounts  this could have been an interesting film  featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth  starring their frontman dani and being hyped up as  the future of british horror   i expected alex chandon s gore fest to live up to the hype i was wrong everything about this film is either cliche or inept  the short story anthology setup was done to death  and much better  in the seventies and eighties  admittedly  the idea of  the sick room  did send a chill down my spine  but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting chandon cannot write dialogue  every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence  the typical  cop on the edge  formula  funny  i m sure i ve seen that somewhere else before     no chandon  you are not tarantino  or scorsese  it sounds bad  add ludicrously ott acting with very dodgy casting  don t get me wrong  dani filth is a great singer and musician  but actor he ain t  and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing  give me bruce campbell any day the visual effects are on the whole poor  with some atrocious cgi  awful gore effects  for goodness sakes  peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget  and editing filters that shriek over use  as for the often mistimed use of cradle of filth s score    man  they should sue the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously  trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience  too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects  eg  maniac  zombie flesh eaters  the beyond  suspiria etc   rendering cradle of fear  in my mind  second rate and obsolete i hope chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares better luck next time',-1

'normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b horror movies  to me the basic principals behind a b horror movie is it s camp value  heavy gore  lots of needless nudity  and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex  i rented cradle of fear strictly because i ve been a fan of the band since they released they re first demo in       the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed  when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder  i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn t laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi hundreds of dollars  the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the  hardcore goth kids who think death  destruction  sex  blood  and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps  that was really it  to me this movie seemed like       of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic  this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this  movie  really is just an extended cradle of filth video',-1

'i rented this dvd for two reasons  a cast of great actors  and the director  even though robert altman can be hit or miss  in this case  it was a big miss  altman s attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester  after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like  dead again   i didn t think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey  and i hope it didn t ruin his reputation  robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one time oscar winners  on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating money films such as this one  duvall was once a great actor in excellent films  even though his best performance was not  tender mercies   but  the great santini   this movie was truly a big waste of time  i give it a   out of',-1

'this movie was made for fans of dani  and cradle of filth   i am not one of them  i think he s just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon  still  i m generally not a fan of black metal   but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it  i convinced myself  that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing  thus i assumed i m in for a roller coaster ride of rubber gore and do it yourself splatter with a sinister background  now  that is what i do like i got home and popped it in  my patience lasted    minutes  awful camera work and disgusting quality  and that was then         that it looked like it was shot using a hi  camcorder  i left it on the shelf  maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this    picture after a couple of months i got back to it  in mentioned surroundings  and saw half  then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me  my disliking evolved  i noticed how funny dani      m       height  looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart   yes  ripping  his head apparently had no skull   i also found that this movie may have no sense  still  i haven t finished it yet  so i wasn t positive after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick   a couple of months back     yes  it took me     years   so   dani in fact was funny as satan manson super evil man s helper and the movie did not make sense  see our bad person employs dani to do bad things  he delivers  why  well i guess he s just very  very bad  as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it we have a couple of short stories joined by dani s character  my favourite was about a guy  who steals someone s leg  because he wants to use it as his own  yeah  exactly the acting s rock bottom  the cgi is the worst ever  i mean stinger beats it  and  boy  is stinger s cgi baaaaad   the story has no sense  and the quality is    let s just say it is not satisfying  the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore  blood and guts are made pretty well  why  you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on   example   dani  the man  filth takes a stuffed cat   fake as can be   and guts it    and then eats what fell out  why  we never know  we do know  however  that this cat must have been on illegal substances  as his heart is almost half his size  you might think  after my comment that this movie is so bad it s good  but it s just bad  cradle of filth fans can add   points  i added one for gore',-1

'this film is a very funny film  the violence is bad  the acting is   well dani  stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do  the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually frustrated goth lads in  personally  i think this movie really does suck  the story and characters could be very good  if say the directing  the actors and other little nibby things were made better  but the film is just bad  the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it  this film is possibly the worst b rate film ever  and  believe me that s hard to achieve  especially when you re competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for  serious  horror movies  i m not a cof fan  and so i just see this as another rubbish movie   a really bad one  if dani made this as a comedy then  good going him  very well done  over than that though  i rate it low  for it s crappiness  watch it when you re in a happy  happy  joy  joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you re high on multiple different types of drugs',-1

'and you can look at that statement in different ways  by the way  first of all  it s a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes  your wildest imagination doesn t even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here  entire parts of this movie are just plain sick  disgusting  offensive  brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out  now  i love horror movies and i am very  pro violence   but i do think that it has to lead somewhere    is that too much to ask   cradle of fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts  the  movie  contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story  this results in endless showing of torture  murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common  not very informative  if you ask me  and yet   it has to be said   the basic plot idea surely has potential  it s about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial  personally  i think that is an interesting topic  so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever secondly  the whole production of this movie was a mess  they didn t have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts   tons of it    the acting performances are a joke and some of the worst i ve ever seen  any other special effects besides the make up looks very amateurish   like that attempt to a realistic car crash  for example    there s no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere   not even an attempt to build up one cradle of fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least  with the presence of death metal icon danni filth   from the band cradle of filth  get the link     this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial  troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this  and then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing   bah  i can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you re easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind  for every self respecting horror fan  this movie is an insult',-1

'this sure is one comedy i m not likely to forget for a while wouldn t normally bother to comment on this movie  it s so minor that no one would watch it anyway  but as it happens  it s kind of popular in p p sharing networks such as kazaa  and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is so what is it then  well  of course it s not really a comedy  instead  it s intended as a horror flick     intended  very much being the key word here  the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess  the special effects are only special in that they re especially pathetic  and as for the acting  well  let s just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school  my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one s expectations  certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned  also  even though i m a big fan of the horror genre  i m aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting but still b movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding  such as humour  the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances  if you can find the humour in that  and i could for the first    minutes or so  gradually dozing off after that  then that s going to be the only thing the movie has to offer  oh  that and two or three pairs of breasts woohoo  how exciting as for the story  it s not even that it doesn t try to convey anything  the victims either use drugs and or are involved in serious crime  the lesson  watch out  naughty boys and girls  because one day you ll be made to pay for what you ve done i rest my case so  all in all  a little bit of sex  a fair amount of drugs  but absolutely zero rock  n roll i rate this one   out of     but would go to   if i could  or perhaps i wouldn t  it deserves a   for spelling the actors  names correctly in the titles  i mean  that s something  innit',-1

'did anyone who was making this movie  particularly the director  spare a thought for the logic of the story line  these are not mere plot holes  but plot graves  that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight  that is  if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave hole plot  or boring and unlikeable  or  in the case of downey s   hannah s characters  apparently superfluous  in pondering the reason for existence of downey s character s significant screen time in the movie  i decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen time  unlikley  as the director didn t change anything else about the script he actually needed to  or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting  i ll leave you to guess which one it was to be i had to keep checking the cover of the dvd to confirm that this really was made by credible talents  i cannot understand why robert altman would take this job  surely he has some power to pick and chose  actually  i can t understand why anyone would take this script on  except a first time director looking for the experience i suppose robert downey jr  needed the money for his habit  i suppose kenneth branagh wanted to try a southern accent  i suppose robert duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing  these are the only motivations i can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie  as for robert altman  plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic  i found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene  or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye s movements  or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood  i do not typically notice such things in movies  since most movies i bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story telling and interesting characters with understandable motives  i watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that dvd cover and being convinced that  due to the talent involved  there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie nice direction  but that s not why i watch movies',-1

'this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen  and i have quite an appetite for awful  and good  movies  it could  just  have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue in cheek    la rocky horror picture show  which was really very funny  other movies  like plan nine from outer space  manage to be funny while  apparently  trying to be serious  as to the acting  it looks like they rounded up brain dead teenagers and asked them to ad lib the whole production  compared to them  tom cruise looks like alec guinness  there was one decent interpretation    that of the older ghoul busting broad on the motorcycle',-1

'this movie is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen  from the very first scene  i knew it would be a smash crash  it starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission  as it turns out  the people in it were possessed by some random zombies  well  some years later  some college kids are pulling some pledge prank  horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock  things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non chalonte manner  with pledge over reacting and over doing the whole  eager to be popular role  what really took the cake with this one is the final battle  absolutely horrible special effects with the guns  for example  guns making a noise with no muzzle flash  and vice versa  this is accompanied by stop animation zombies  why they move in stop motion is a mystery   cheesy music  and about    guns that come out of nowhere overall  this movie is crap  just like so many others you can rent for    cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place',-1

'this film wasn t programmed in italian cinemas i have seen it at a manifestation called  fantafestival  i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark  the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there s no suspence in the film  music is completely out of the story and i don t have words to describe the visual effects if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting  but a few minutes later it becomes busy the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review',-1

'when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby  the first thing they say is  what do you think of such and such movie   there are a couple of problems here  firstly  there is the probable chance that i ve not seen it and thus  i ruin my reputation  secondly  i could trash the movie in question without realising that it s actually their favourite  lastly  i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion  thus  i find myself sat before  the convent  which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here  more s the pity because this frankly dreadful  horror  is about as scary as a box of kittens following well worn clichs   the convent  focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned  laid and mildly spooked  but you ll never guess what happens next  a group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition  will any of them survive and more importantly  haven t you got better things to worry about the only thing that saves  the convent  from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of coolio s bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger  it s far too amusing to be properly frightening   the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason  the day glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie   but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered  but even if they were trying  i still doubt that it would work   demonic nuns wearing the sort of make up you d see in the  buffy the vampire slayer  tv show aren t really that scary  the scariest thing about this movie really is that over     of voters gave this a maximum score  i mean  i know it s funny but i hardly split my sides  to be honest  i ve had more fun in a dentist  the convent  isn t really a horror movie as such  it s more of a comedy horror like  scary movie  or  shaun of the dead  but you re laughing at it instead of with it  i honestly can t recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then  i doubt very much they d enjoy it  i don t enjoy the  so bad that it s good  genre   i personally feel that if the film makers can t be bothered to salvage a turkey then i shouldn t bust a gut trying to watch it  yes  it s a bad film and yes  they really should have gone home and done something more constructive  a rubik s cube  for example  the dvd box has two price stickers   one for      and a reduced price of    but it was sold for   and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy  cheap  awesomely bad flick  sorry if you do like it but  the convent  really is a pile of unholy crap',-1

'this film is absolutely horrific  one of the worst movies i ve ever seen  the story does nearly not exist  the characters are full of stereotypes and the special fx only make you laugh  the only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the rapper coolio as some kind of police officer if this film was supposed to be a comedy i didn t quite get the point  if you want to watch this movie  please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs   especially when the first special fx appear on the screen but if you like trash movies made on the cheap  this film is a must see for you',-1

'rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent  there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film  what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings  actors of stature   robert duvall  robert downey  jr    are deployed in roles which go nowhere  a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee stained camera lens  a writer  john grisham  who has never produced anything of merit  discovers new depths of under motivated incoherence  the film has a cheap  lecherous feel about it   but barely at the level of commentary   its really part of the aesthetic  normally  i come on to the imdb to write balanced  generally appreciative comments  this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless  bilious rant  i won t  but only because i no longer want to occupy my  mind  with this trash',-1

'i thought that this movie was pretty lame  if you re looking for cheesey  you may like this  i  myself  don t mind a fair amount of cheese  but this was ridiculous  the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak the only thing entertaining about this movie was the day glo zombies  but even that isn t reason enough to see this flick',-1

'i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great  so i went out and bought it  what a mistake  the acting is a shambles  the special effects  if you could call them that   look like something that wouldn t be out of place at a school play  some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen  which unfortunately is all to often  as for a story  forget it  this is a warning  don t waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen  if  for some reason  you like this film watch troll    you will probably enjoy that as well',-1

'i have seen a lot of bad films  most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is  but this really takes badness to new extremes it is bland  the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it  there are no shocks  no horror  no suspense  just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish a blight on the crappy horror genre  avoid at all costs',-1

'i know you ve read that before  on countless other films no doubt if you re reading the comments here  but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i ve been able to track down  no doubt the really bad ones aren t even available to buy or watch on tv  but even so i feel it s fair to qualify that i m not just some dumb renter who picked badly i ve seen two thirds of the bottom     ranked films here on the imdb  and i m ticking of the remaining ones with every chance  most of those stand head and shoulders above this    excersize in absolute monotony i like to rate truly bad films  as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are  by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through  if you can watch it by yourself  it isn t that bad  if you can watch it with one single friend    it s bad but could be a lot worse it took   of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy  and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films  spotting the boom mic for example    times in this one if i m not mistaken  could take away the dry taste in my mouth  yes i d watched it  but i d also forced   of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end i hope and pray we saw the directors cut    to think that there could be a version with    more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me  so much of the film centers around this i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget  just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes  but it isn t a good film  the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money  considering inflation  and was an utter gem  it s not an excuse for how bad this baby is spoilers ahead   it s not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters    the pacing of the film    is insane    nothing    is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging  no matter what your alignment or sex    rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time the acting is cheese    but not overly amatuer    i ve seen a lot worse in better films    but somehow it s the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you ll ever hear in a film  that really grates rent this if  like me  you have a fascination with the worst of the worst  and only if you re going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it  this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair  it s an endurance test you probably want to skip i m sure there is worse    but i wouldn t be surprised if it has decoteau s name on it',-1

'this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life   it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous   and i have never seen such bad acting in my life  the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially drew fuller   i don t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie   i didn t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves  i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn  i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch  i was very disappointed   the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion',-1

'nothing in this movie is funny  i thought the premise  giving a human the libido of a randy ram  was interesting and should provide for some laughs  wrong  there is simply nothing funny about the movie  for example  the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer s yard is not funny  it borders on obscenity  they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level  and it just aint funny we all know that dogs will eat anything  anywhere  anytime  the main character doing this with everything  everywhere  everytime is also not funny  it becomes a cliche rob schneider is  i guess  acceptable in the role  by this  i mean that he s not a bad actor  but with rotten material it s difficult to comment on quality  however  coleen haskell  the other half of the human romantic leads  does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too    seems embarrassed by the whole thing  as well she should be  she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum  detached from all the other actors in the movie see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless  dull  repetitive material',-1

'this movie is a total dog  i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn t feel like i d totally wasted my money  and my time  the writing in this film is absolutely terrible  it s a shame it s not up to the standards of other hale storm movies they should have saved the money on getting d list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right  even gary coleman wasn t properly utilized for his role this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was  including the subplots  after viewing this movie  i m left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite like humor  where it s not so much the lines as the character and the delivery  unfortunately  this movie fails to deliver the lines  the characters  the delivery or the humor  i should have gone to the dentist instead',-1

'i went to see this film with fairly low expectations  figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff  sadly  it wasn t even that  i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out  i went with my two kids  ages    and     and even they kept asking   how much longer   after lasting until the end  i just kept wondering who would approve this script  even the reliable fred willard couldn t save the trite dialogue  the state jokes  and the banal plot  i d suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie  i use the term loosely  should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class  at the least  there are many books on directing  screen writing  and producing movies that would teach them something about structure  plot  dialogue and pacing',-1

'the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget  halestorm entertainment  has had to work with  all involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash  not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful  but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best  the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop pc  the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing  i think just because i couldn t believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the  film',-1

'first of all  let me say the i am lds or rather  i am a mormon  so when i watched this film  i automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt  i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch  and this one was no exception  it does have its redeeming moments  but they are few and far between one of the first things i noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though halestorm was ashamed of our church  in the lds church  congregations are called  wards  and the basketball court is in the  cultural hall   never once are either of these two names mentioned  the church is never referred to by name and  the standards  is as far as it goes in mentioning what our church believes it makes me wonder if the directors are really lds or lds wannabes  this film had so much potential  it could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer  but also what we believe  instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired  if i were not already lds  i d be left thinking mormons are stupid  idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs it is not a film i will recommend to my nonlds friends sorry halestorm  you can do better than this',-1

'every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people  if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie  how great will be my joy where to begin my discussion of pain  for starters  there was a musical montage every five minutes  there was no character development  every character was a stereotype  we had swearing guy  fat guy who eats donuts  goofy foreign guy  etc  the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot  the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation  have the directors  producers  etc  ever even seen a movie before  halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry  the concept for this movie sounded so funny  how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors  but trust me when i say this  things went wrong  very wrong',-1

'though the movie may have been  true  to lewis s book  in that the script was basically word for word  verbatim   it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this  the mythical creatures  unicorns  centaurs  griffins  ghouls  ghosts  are  drawn  in  and as in the previous review  the green screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow  i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth  i nearly cried when i heard the wolf s  howl    a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could all of the acting is tremendously forced  especially that of little lucy penvensie    i could only take so much indignation  desperation  and buck teeth in the  what felt like  fourteen hours of watching the movie  the actress who plays the white witch  in all her histrionics  seems that she d be more at home on stage  where a booming voice  spread arms  and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome the sets feel claustrophobic  whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors  indoors  it s as if bbc could only afford to spend      on constructing a set  and so it is very small  and all the characters are constantly huddled together  the white witch s castle is a run down  rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting  when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods   actually   any  scene in the woods   feels like they are simply wandering around in circles the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan  but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film s entire budget on building the mechanical feline  it looks great when it s standing still and before it starts speaking  but once it starts moving  you can t help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear end in the lion suit yes  if you are a hardcore narnia fan  you may want to see this version  simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote   but lewis was certainly no screenwriter  and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen  during the scene in which the children are at the beavers  and getting ready to flee from the wolves  mrs  beaver s incessant   oh  just one more thing  dearies  and then we will be ready to go   punctuated by the children s simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of  no  mrs  beaver  please      a scene of comic relief  so incongruous  they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger  not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not   detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have  in fact  the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these i would recommend seeing the new narnia  disney        the new movie  with updated effects  spectacular computer animation  great timing all around  and a gorgeous and scene  stealing white witch  who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician  as opposed to a shrieking banshee  captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis s original vision  i think   lucy is a lot cuter  no buck teeth  yay    as are the beavers  and realistically sized   and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine  desperately hungry for acceptance insecure and  angsting with an inferiority complex edmund that the new disney version fronts unless you re the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies  i would not recommend this film to anyone',-1

'this contains many  many spoilers  not that it matters  since everything is so patently obvious    oh my god  where do i start  well  here   this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said  i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now  it is my civic duty   such is the badness of this flick  begin digression  but let me just state one thing before i start  i m not some harvard art major film noir weenie  in fact  i went to the college at the other end of mass  ave in cambridge  the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go  which should put me squarely in the nerd who would obsessively love comic book films census group  and still i hated this film      my viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the die hards  bond flicks  clerks  and the grail  i wish the titanic had never sunk  not so much for the lives lost  but so we wouldn t have been subjected to that dung heap of a film  and the single and only reason i will watch a snooty french art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed emmanuelle beart in it  i even gave maximum overdrive one of its precious few   s here on imdb  for god s sake  so i m as shallow as they come  therefore i m not criticizing this film because i m looking for some standard of cinematic excellence   it s because elektra stinks like a three week old dead goat   end digression ok  there s so much badness here that i have to try to categorize it  here goes ms  garner  one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot jgar  i have no idea why my wife wanted to   i think that between this and  finding nemo   the latter was the sexier film  you know the red outfit she s advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see  you see her in it twice   once at the beginning  once at the end  bummer  in the rest  she basically looks like what morrissey would look like if he were a female   lots of pouting and black clothes  which brings me to the incredible range of expression jgar shows in her acting   ranging from  pouting  all the way to  pouting and crying   oh my god  you d think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that  um  wait   the bad guys gal  they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you d expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit  at least next to jgar s performance  it doesn t stand out too badly  one guy s role is to stand there and be huge  another s is to stand there and have stuff come out of him  and the woman s role is to stand there and breathe on and or kiss people  they manage to pull these incredible feats off  the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all   he has to simultaneously a  appear angry and b  appear asian  he does a fine job at this  i think there was a fifth bad guy gal  but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self defense plot twists  this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the democratic national convention  let s just put it this way   my wife  who has only been in the u s  for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english   whispered this to me when the girl first appears in jg s pad  and i swear to god i am not making this up   she go to house to kill girl  and father too   and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen  now my wife isn t stupid  but she isn t being courted by mensa for her gifts  either  and she s had zero exposure to daredevil or the comic book genre  and she figured this out in        seconds with no prodding and no prior information  such is the blatant obviousness of this film rarely before seen stupidity  ok  so there s this big dude in the film  he can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it s lint  and he can take a vicious electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal  or melt it   or something   more defenses kicking in  thank god   but jg jumps on his head  and he explodes  an achilles noggin  ok  such is the mind numbing stupidity of this film ack  i m starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on  so i have to stop  but you have been warned  if you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie  do it  and if armageddon is going to come  please let it be  before  this comes out on dvd',-1

'while some scenes of training were realistic  too many of them depicted military instructors as ex nazi types  obviously  the people who wrote the screen play were either anti military types or writing a film for that audience i am a viet nam vet and  even during this period  military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison and i really loved the scene where the  hero  and his buddy  both privates  are sitting down in the captain s office  smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their buddy  this sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation  as was the purpose for the scene at the end i asked myself   what was this film about   as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except  i hate all authority   thank god i got it from the library and did not pay to rent it',-1

'how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me  overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie  terrible script  with forced character quirks  the brown sauce   romanticising all that is bad about dublin  the attitude of  ah  it s a dump but sure isnt it great all the same   plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences  the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase   and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney s character  a great actor forced to play this part that could ve been written by a five year old  cringeworthy stuff  the best thing about this movie is farrell  and it s a bad when you have to say that  well  at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent  international audiences be warned  stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock  you ll have a better time  intermission is a walk outer',-1

'i m irish and i ve been living in denmark for a while so i was looking forward to going home last week so i could see intermission  and i will go on record as saying this film is awful it is not quite as bad a something like  the most fertile man in ireland  but it definitely does not stand up there with other irish films such as the commitments  i went down or michael collins some aspects of the film are actually quite funny  such as colm meaneys american style garda  but the film itself is shot completely wrong  the bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom in  zoom out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama  but it isn t  this is an irish lock  stock and two smoking barrels and it should be shot like this  it should have smooth movement from one shot to the next  the film just looks sloppy and thrown together the performances are okay  given the awful script  a friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed colin farrell around dublin for a week  he gives a decent display as a dublin dirtbag  but it no way compares to his performances in minority report  tigerland or phone booth  the best performance was from dierdre o kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman  i think she should leave her god awful stand up and focus more on her acting all in all  its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best irish films ever i m expecting a backlash from these comments because most people i have spoken to have said it was great  but before you reply  ask yourself  would think so highly of this movie if it was set in england or america',-1

'a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one  it needed some dependence on something this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people  were they trying to imitate the wonderful film  crash   if so  this film crashed entirely there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem the film is just too choppy to work  one woman loses her husband after    years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor  this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing  the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance then  we have   losers who purchase masks to rob a bank  obviously  the robbery goes awry but there doesn t seem to be any punishment for the crooks  perhaps  the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film',-1

'i live in ottawa where this film was made and i really wish it hadn t been  this is one god awful flick  i really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is  indie films blow  well  this film does nothing to shed this curse  the actor  writer  director brett kelly does little to contribute to the genre  rather he re hashes tired clichs from movies past  i am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting  it s way too overdone i can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights  now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension  but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie  as well for a movie that dares to call itself horror  a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore  other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring the biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development  the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back  not that this concept bugs me  but  i didn t really find it believable that when the two main characters  both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other  this is done in such a short time span that it s inconceivable  my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her the last point that i have is     and i won t hold this against kelly  but the movie is shot entirely on boring  emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film  although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat  my only hope is that something happens to prevent brett kelly from making a sequel  which has been reported on his website  a sequel that was half written in one sitting lord help us all',-1

'usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn t have a lower rating  and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating  this is not the case here bonesetter is a perfect example of a      film  it does nothing right and it doesn t have the chance to because it doesn t really attempt to do anything  there are strands of a bad d d  novel kind of plot which doesn t hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout  it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort  because even a completely patently untalented persons  hard work would amount to more  a truly awful film',-1

'words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is  i wish it were  so bad it s good   but it s not  it s just dull  lifeless  and boring  it s so bad i couldn t even laugh at it in response to other posters  anne marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie  the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly  who as a true statement on vanity  cast himself as the male lead  they both look like inbreeds  sister and brother the gal  sherry thurig  is a looker  the complete opposite of anne marie   attractive  this girl is tall and willowy  and can act  although you can tell she s holding back all the actors seem to be holding back  especially the supporting male  mark  i ve seen less wood in a rain forest  but he s still better than kelly  why would kelly keep his actors from acting  is he really that bad a director  everyone else has summed the story up perfectly   there isn t one  kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime  i know how he felt stepping in the poo  it s how i felt after watching his movie yes  i tried to get my money back from the rental store  this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director  and if you search them out  you ll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks',-1

'or listening to  for that matter  even the soundtrack is a bore honestly  this isn t the worst gay movie i ve seen  that would be regarding billy   but it s down there very close to the bottom of the barrel this thing drags and drags and drags  it s not that the plot is inane  in the hands of a good writer it might have worked       it certainly could have been much more entertaining  there s not one plot point you can t see coming for ten miles down the road  the dialog is flat  the jokes are old  to add insult to injury  it s full of one dimensional  stereotypical gays nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible  much less real  there was no chemistry  no dynamic  in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other       we re just told they re in love  hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren t compatible sexually  they like the same book  huh the acting is not totally bad  but the pacing is excruciatingly slow  i mean  almost jarmusch  slow  but without jarmusch quality  in fact  that would be a good barometer for you  if you like jarmusch films  avoid this one',-1

'i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it s about  somebody got murdered or maybe they didn t and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn t  this brought back memories of the good old days  bad old days   when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers  lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism  mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time  i ve never found margaret atwood s books easy to read  this movie continues that fine canadian tradition  it isn t easy to watch  maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it  us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious',-1

'i don t know what margaret atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book  i ve always been a big fan of the robber bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works  i am aware that the translation of book to movie isn t perfect but this movie was the worst ever  the names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it  i feel like i lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie  this really should have been a mini series to tell the story the way it was written the actors for roz  tony  charis and zenia were well chosen even though i was skeptical at first about mary louise parker  i only wish they d had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all',-1

'when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film  i was intrigued  being a fan of the book  i assumed she d be playing tony  roz  or charis  but more so  i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head y  almost psychological  but not psychological thriller  novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn t read the novel  and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had  the book is a complex reflection of society  women  and modern life  and i was interested to see how they used the   different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film  what they actually did was a crime the biggest error and confusing issue is  why would oxygen  a network that advertises as being for women  take an amazing book about how complex  wonderful  and terrible women are and can be  and change the protagonist from   women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story  it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz  tony  and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that  they rushed through bulk of the book  in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it  aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with  in the film  these women aren t people  they are characters in the book zenia does fake her death  but the book mentions it to get this point across  while the film wastes       minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use  they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia  which was so wrong  zenia is a catherine zeta jones  angelina jolie  or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type  she is a woman men can t not adore  and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by  but in a  keep your enemies closer  kind of way  and once she gets closer  she seems totally genuine and trust worthy  despite your better judgment  she s the kind of woman who  even when she loses  she wins  she s always still beautiful  still rich  and there are always still people out there who don t know her game in the film  zenia didn t take charis s man  the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place     but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian  and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies   and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august  but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed  it s was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book  but i think had i not read the book  i would have spent the whole movie confused  if i had bothered to stick with it at all and roz s husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture  which was weird since zenia took roz s business and home life in the book  which is why roz hated her so much  and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz s husband years and years back  and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever   even at the party where zenia and west  in the book  had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it  and evil  bitchy  person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it  tony s character was so wrong in this film   she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky  mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book  the film basically implied smart women are evil  beautiful women are evil  powerful women are evil  and women who teach yoga are off their rockers they basically tried to make it so zenia wasn t necessarily as awful as she was in the book  and then  in the end  the three women convince this former cop  who  of course in the process of researching this  meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous  which of course zenia bails on  to hide zenia s body  which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at  but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony  or they conspired together to do it     and then zenia also managed to take all of roz s money in the process  by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been if you aren t confused by this breakdown of the film  then maybe you would like it  because i have read the book and seen the movie  and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused  it was terrible  i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task  but if you are going to take on the task  you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary  instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of',-1

'if i had never read the book  i would have said it was a good movie  but i did read the book  who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline  there is so many changes  that it wasn t really worthy of the title  character changes  plot changes  time line changes   first off who was henry and the investigator  they weren t in the story  henry had mitch s persona somewhat  but mitch wasn t a cop  no you made it so roz  helped  sink   his body and used that as zenia s blackmail against roz  the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him  her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother  her son wasn t even really mentioned in the story  neither i don t believe was his lover  roz s secretary tony and west were not together in the beginning  he was actually with zenia first while in college  the black painted apartment was their idea  tony just went to visit  this is where zenia and tony meet  become fast friends  tony hides her love for west  then zenia left west  with cash from tony  then west and tony get together  eventually marry  at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time  only to be heart broken again  then go back to tony  zenia s blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia  now being a professor at college she didn t want to let it get out  i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfully charis character was a blond  not that it really matters  zenia didn t trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive  no she was there when charis had a lover named billy  augusta s father  he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war  eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal  zenia and billy have an affair right under charis s nose while taking care of them both  then zenia turns in billy to the government  and leaves on the ferry with him  not with augusta  charis was pregnant with her tho  charis also had a split personality  karen was her real name zenia did not die from being cut up into piece s     she fell or was possibly pushed  we never really knew  off the balcony and landed in a fountain  she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she od d  she was also really dieing of cancer this time around it didn t show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader  the book was striped down to its bare bones  then re made in someone else s vision  why couldn t you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie  it was different enough  and i m sure could have been made more so',-1

'warning   no plot spoilers ahead  but movie spoilers nonetheless     my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all star cast  wow   very  very wrong  this movie is an overdone  overwrought  and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film    years after it was shot  the copyright date on the box said       yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early     s  and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late   s early   s dresses and hairdos  it looked as if it had been shot a good    or    years before the rest of the film  i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback  and therefore supposed to look old  but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more   s than   s or even   st century trying to be   s    then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up  and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences  yet it s a different  much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks   i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included   it was all the flashback sequences  shot in      as a complete student film of the same title as this movie  it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up  and indeed acting the co worker in the      scenes   thus  this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old  re cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time  the shell story  shot in       is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead  something about a promise made by the dying man in the early    s to his girl that they would meet on the  fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium   an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in        these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful  overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichd action that permeates the new movie  don t bother  there s a reason why you ve never heard of this movie even though it has a well known cast   it s terrible',-1

'i got this movie in the    bin at walmart  i would not recommend watching this move  i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for   hours i looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie  i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on  it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie  it s just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another  the drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam okay  here is my rant about this movie  to me  this movie is slow and hard to watch  it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end  it doesn t  after the movie was over i through it behind my t v  because i was angry that i wasted almost   hours of my life watching it  and another    minutes writing this review to warn people about it',-1

'i ended up watching this whole  very long  movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it  it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people  anthony quinn  lawrence olivier  john gielguld  vittorio de sica  etc   would have willingly participated in this farce  but maybe in      people really  were  so naive  the plot seems written by some confused latin american marxist priest with an agenda  there is a superpower conflict and the russians are actually the good guys  with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man  who  suddenly  after    years  sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a siberian gulag  the priest then promptly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences  we are allowed to see the secret vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine meanwhile  the communists in china achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death  to solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war  in order to justly distribute the western capitalist riches to the poor workers of china  our good old comrade general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace  they meet with the chinese leader comrade peng who looks and acts like a    year old boy  you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in      thought the chinese looked like  comrade peng demands that the western capitalists must pay  which is quite logical after all  don t capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists    and that the pope needs to sacrifice something  too  for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice so when the pope gets crowned in rome  he pledges the entire wealth of the catholic church world wide to feed our poor chinese brethren in christ  and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust apart from this  there are also some minor sub plots  which  alas  provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie  i d give it three oscars for stupidity by the way  anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope  he is much more plausible as zorba the greek',-1

'anyone who has watched comedy central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie  i first saw ads for this movie back in       it looked like it could be funny  but i wasn t about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first  i figured i would wait until the movie was available to rent at blockbuster about a year and a half later  i was at tower records and in the  dvds for less than      pile  there was a copy of this movie  seeing that the dvd was only       i decided to buy it  i got home  put the disc in the dvd player  and waited for the laughs to start   and i waited some more  the laughs never came i d have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when i say that this movie was horrible  sick  desperately tasteless  and poorly written and directed  the underground comedy movie is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time  no stars',-1

'the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies i ve ever seen  i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase  guaranteed to offend  written on it    meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh this movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits  bad characters  and worse jokes    from the pathetic bat man sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold shvollenpecker skit  they just aren t funny  the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between   watching micheal clark duncan play a gay virgin  for example   but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince offer s ineptness at comedy keep the underground comedy movie underground    bury it',-1

'first of all     what the hell  why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing  offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn t watch what the crap is funny about a dog being injured  a grandma getting her head knocked off   a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom  what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick  anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny  should not even be allowed to walk the earth but from what i hear its not even offensive   so   they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage   and they cant even pull that off',-1

'this film had a lot of promise  and the plot was relatively interesting  however the actors  director and editors seriously let this film down i feel bad for the writers  it could have been good  the acting is wooden  very few of the characters are believable who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film  there are lots of quick  flashy  edits in almost every scene  which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no  it left me feeling like i d wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money',-1

'words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is  it is a series of random  unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady  really disturbing   the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco  the best actor in this movie  also  it is rated nc     shunning away the only people that might tolerate it',-1

'i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru   not one laugh in it  ok  maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big  black  bald gay virgin  but the rest of it was shockingly un funny  on top of being void of any laughs the  skits  go on forever  steer clear of this one if you value your time and money  dreadful    the worst',-1

'how do i begin  this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen  it has no redeemable qualities  i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle it failed to get even a single smile on my face i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film  i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor  the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack  i m pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap  i will leave you with this warning  do not watch this film  it sucks',-1

'it really impresses me that it got made  the director writer actor must be really charismatic in reality  i can think of no other way itd pass script stage  what i want you to consider is this   while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors  it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there  not enjoying it  just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying  id really like to know what the budget is  guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor  i want to write  the jokes didn t appeal to me   but the reality is for them to appeal to you  you d have to be the man who wrote them  or a retard  so imagine that in script form   and this guy got that green lit  thats impressive isn t it',-1

'this movie shows a row of sketches  which partly pass over into one another  i realized the passing over late in the movie  at first it only irritated me many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact  using absurdity and obscenity  the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails my personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie  my god  it hurts in my head every time i call it  movie    a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great  but it failed  at least the director made something out of nothing  but it isn t something good many movies didn t turn out as funny as they were planned  but this one tops them all  it s the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making  no  to correct myself  it s even worse than that  a movie with gags so bad  that they aren t funny at all  it s not even fun to watch the lead actor  writer and director  all three the same guy by the way  perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies  the movie is too bad for that',-1

'this film stars  among others   slapchop  vince offer  who also wrote  edited and directed  and joey buttafuoco  not exactly names that scream out  quality   and with such uplifting skits as  supermodels taking a dump   it s exactly what it sounds like   a guy who robs a sperm bank  the  rhymer    necrophilia with a rotting corpse  black market fetuses  featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar   lots and lots of gay jokes  a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions  the skits are painfully unfunny  such as  batman and rhymer    the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude   and stupid  i truly believe a group of   year olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budget apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by  slap shot  vince against the scientologists  frankly  i wouldn t know who to root for in this case    apparently  he alleged that somehow scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film  no matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and     unfunny  by comparison  ebola is funnier    and these are the nicest things i can say about the movie by the way  that is bobby lee  from  mad tv   wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film  it s amazing his career could overcome this',-1

'lately they have been trying to hock this film late night on cable tv commercials  don t believe the hype  i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres  this is  in my opinion  the  rd worst movie of all time  just behind mac   me     worst   and jack frost     worst   but i must admit  they are all close and all terrible  really  nothing of this movie is funny  or disturbing  or anything else it claims to be so don t waste your money  the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy  i m not lying about that  someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film  it is that awful  if you don t believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this  which i doubt you can finish  two thumbs enthusiastically down',-1

'i bought this at tower records after seeing the info mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central  i was actually really looking forward to watching this  my god where did i go wrong  now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies  hell i own over       dvd s  with that said  the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen  i tried to give it a chance  but not only was it not funny  it had no point  did not offend what so ever and was all around stupid  god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny  this is going right to the bottom of the bin',-1

'i rated this movie as awful      after watching the trailer  i thought this movie could be pretty cool   guaranteed to offend   everyone   the trailer said  well   it did offend me  because this movie really sucks  it is hardly a comedy  as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie  and what s with all the gays in this movie  i m not gay and i don t have a problem with those who are  but what s the point of adding so many gay scenes in a so called comedy movie  when these scenes are absolutely not funny  i guess the director is a gay man in denial  or something like that so my advice to you is  if you want to waste good money  go rent a good comedy you ve already seen a million times  you ll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy s  it really is total crap',-1

'this movie doesn t even deserve a one  this was an utter waste of time  it was a waste of film and money  it was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting  my spoiler is one that i think should be read by everyone  there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language  but not only that  there is no plot line  the actors are terrible  the accents are horrible  the actors are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie the only reason i rented it was for brian van holt  who got only a fifteen second part  by the way   i think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times  adding only a new sentence a film similar to this is eraser head  possibly the most disturbing movie in existence  there is no plot line  and is not funny  although it isn t trying to be funny  do not watch either movie',-1

'and i repeat  please do not see this movie  this is more than a review  this is a warning  this sets the record for the worst  most effortless comedy ever made  at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays  the gags are crude and flat  but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny  i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos  everyone thinks they can do comedy  and only    percent of them are right  comedy is hard  this is not some genre any fool can play around with  i think it s atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to  kentucky fried movie   basically  these bozos are comparing their so called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers  come on  i ve seen pauly shore movies that are    times funnier than  the underground comedy movie   here s a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie  one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named d  kman  the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen  that s it  that s the whole joke  wow  this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes  another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie  and in another sketch  there s a bag lady beauty contest  in which we re exposed to the horrible sights of bikini clad middle aged women with beer guts and stretch marks  plus  making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny  it s a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped  the whole movie is supposed to be a satire  i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire   is truth    for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap  explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags  some of the sketches might ve sounded funny on paper  but anybody who s taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper  it probably won t be funny on screen  if i tell someone about a big  black  muscular gay virgin  who s saving himself for the right man  he or she would probably laugh  but watching the premise played out on screen for about    minutes is a complete drag  i hate how whenever people criticize a low brow comedy like this for not being funny  they re regarded as stuck up squares  i just saw  white chicks  recently  that s another low brow  politically incorrect comedy  but i laughed my head off  the most offensive thing about  the underground comedy movie  is it s not funny  what the writers and directors don t understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn t work  there has to be more  just think of the famous scene from  there s something about mary   ironically  enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list   the joke about the semen wasn t just funny because it involved bodily fluids  there was a buildup  ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn t go out on a date with a  loaded gun   then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released  a knock is on the door  and he has to answer it  his date  mary  is at the door and that s when it s revealed that the semen is hanging off ben s ear  in this movie  there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people  with no buildup whatsoever  as jay leno always says   this comedy thing s not so easy  is it   keep that in mind  vince offer   cause you weren t cut out for this genre   the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip  let s face it  nowadays it s hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect  i know comedy is subjective   but this movie shouldn t be funny to anybody  except maybe the filmmakers themselves  as a side note  the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan s fame in movies like  armageddon  and  the green mile   there can t be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show  all the others in the cast are either non actors  has been actors or b movie stars  karen black made a good impression in  five easy pieces   but i don t think she s done anything of value ever since  slash was probably drugged into being in this film  gina lee nolin is nothing without  baywatch   angelyne is the film s biggest star  keeping in mind duncan wasn t famous at the time   and there are still probably a ton of people who haven t heard of her  for good reason  usually  i m in support of extremely low budget flicks  but this one deserves to drift into obscurity  i hope to lord this doesn t become a cult classic  shouldn t there be a law against distributing crap like this',-1

'i m into bad movies but this has nothing going for it  despite what the morons above have said  it is not funny  i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director   writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again  to love movies and comedy is to despise this film  i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was  if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here  zero  if you need to compare underground movies  see  kentucky fried movie  or early john waters  the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire  the rule for comedy is this     if it s funny you can say or do anything but if it s not funny you are not satirical  you are not edgy  you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny  zero',-1

'hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward it is something like    minutes long but would be better in ten  there s like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops  and habits in a church tower like quasimodo  only he is much less sympathetic  there s a strange love story involved which doesn t have anything to do with anything  she happens to look like his mother  yes so what  we know he misses his mother  that s what the first ten minutes were about  they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o k  short film  now it s a portrait of a character who doesn t change  he is a guy that stuff happens to  the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job there s this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character  he paints his face  dresses in women s clothing and wears a dead badger on his head  a badger  you ve got to see the ending  he returns to his home with the badger on his head  and it is shot like a tacky horror film  to kill his dad s new wife  which he had sex with in the beginning   and somehow they thought this wouldn t be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background  i ve got to admit though  i m kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose  it feels like this mackenzie director guy whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school  you are so smart  thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories  you really dug  what a wallraff  okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book  but anyway  photowise it is boring  a lot of talking heads  plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene  you know cold and warm etc   why  maybe  hallam foe  is both a feature and a test film for color blind people  or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn t be enough to tell us that he feels lonely  so they increased blue so that we really get it i m not even gonna comment on the clich indie oh how how how cute drawings they have made in the presentation  and all the  cute  sex stuff going on  this whole film is an independent clich  but i do recommend it  i laughed more than a few times  though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine',-1

'once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing  i just recently reviewed baby face nelson  now i ve seen dillinger and i ve had it this movie is garbage  i don t know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde  this movie is far from a classic  someone called it brilliant  that s an insane thing to say  this movie can t get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i ve ever seen  i don t know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger  first of all he looks nothing like him  second of all  by the time john dillinger was killed he was     when oates made this he was     you could even tell that he s older than the real dillinger just by looking at him  not only was he too old  but so was ben johnson as melvin purvis they show baby face nelson die  then homer van meter  and finally john dillinger  john dillinger was killed before both of them  the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson  not only do the writers not know when they died  but they also don t know how they died  baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe  homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns  homer van meter was cornered by the police in st  paul and gunned down with machine guns  another member of dillinger s gang  harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie  pierpont wasn t shot  harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair  i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i m not going to go into it again here  let me also add that richard dreyfuss  portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic  there s a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating  while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming   leave me alone   baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought  maybe dillinger didn t agree with nelson s bank robbing methods  but they never fought  nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten  they keep calling him lester  baby face  nelson  he was never in his life known by that name  nelson s real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson  the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood  but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood  john milius doesn t know anything  where the hell did john milius get his information  i could probably make a better movie than him finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable  the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette  by the way  billie frechette wasn t even there that night  but a girl named polly hamilton was  melvin purvis yells   johnny   dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell  it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night  the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away  they didn t even have to shoot him  they were so close that powder burns were found on his face  it was murder  they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger  after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man  the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillinger s death  i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn t john dillinger  but i ll stop here  if you would like to know more check it out heresee the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want  but don t waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie',-1

'i just finished reading a book about dillinger  this movie was horribly inaccurate  it s like they got a list of names and just made everything up  his robberies and getaways were well planned  down to the second   when the time was up  they left whether they had all of the money or not  they had notes of every road  where to turn  etc  purvis never saw him at the restaurant  he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left  purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed  only photos of him  the way his gang members died were fictitious  dillinger never robbed a bank by himself  like he did in this movie  if i had never read the book  maybe i could have enjoyed the movie  the acting was a bit over the top in places  the action was overdone as well  on second thought  i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn t read the book',-1

'i recently watched this film at the    th gothenburg film festival  and to be honest it was on of the worst films i ve ever had the misfortune to watch  don t get me wrong  there are the funny and entertaining bad films  e g  manos  hands of fate   and then there are the awful bad films   this one falls into the latter category   the cinematography was unbelievable  and not in a good way  it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus  with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot   the lighting was something between  one guy running around with a light bulb  and  non existing   the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors  and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them  the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer  a classic look a la jason vorhees from  friday the    th   the plot was extremely poor  and the ending even worse  i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like  or maybe an insomniac needing sleep',-1

'i love new york  is another entry by vh    mtv networks  showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill  obnoxious  woman  it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest  ebonics speaking  craziest contestant   and her mother   and give them a show on this network  many will argue   this is a show   true  it s not as bad as it s previous show   flavor of love    but it s just as bad it reminds me of a skit from the    s show  in living color  where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on  the love connection  dating show and he picked  robin givens  for a date  mike talked of how the date was okay  but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in  this show reminds me of that the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more    i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her   and her mother   to give you a name that is so ghetto  you ll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv   but these are professional reality actors  so why bother it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this  the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions     minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network   well  you can t hate them for trying to make a buck   maybe the wonder is   who would want to be with this woman past an hour  or wonder if she and her mother s next show would be on the wwf  any way you slice it  it s a train wreck you ve seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck  or any different from any of the others  appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an  end  to reality shows  this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end  immediately',-1

'it must be the most corniest tv show on the air  this is probably a escape for jim belushi and all of his bad movies  his brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother  i hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use  jim has got to retire or something  please let them go of the air  if i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush  id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing  i still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running  we all know deep down that we want to shoot our tv screens when we see jim s face  in conclusion  no more please',-1

'all the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character jim being either a bad father  a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish  how can that be funny  of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed  but jim s character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner and why it that  my guess is that it s because  he should now better   jim s not a stupid guy  he can take care of things and he s got the opportunities to do so  but he chooses not to  it s a conscious choice he makes  when he chooses to not play with his kids  not go shopping because he doesn t want to buy  lady products  and it s a choice he makes  when he puts down his relatives the other characters seems to only be in the series so jim can have someone to be a jerk to  if the cheryl character was a real person  she would have left him years ago  and not stay with the deadbeat for   years  but alas  she s just a catalyst for jim s quirky middle class extreme selfishness',-1

'you need to watch this show once to have seen them all  the formula is exactly the same in each episode  jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife  at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her  she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully  in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that i ll take a stab at one now episode  valentines pay jims wife notices that all of jims weekly pay has disappeared  he then explains to her he lost it at the casino  she screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is  then on valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball  hence explaining the missing wages   she realizes  her  mistake and the usual  oh jim  you re so lovely     the endanother very obvious item is the fact that jims character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant  when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because we re so many now in terms of human beings with tvs  these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you d get an audience  two and a half men  on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious',-1

'i wish i could say that this show was unusual in it s banality but it is usual in every way it has the dumb husband his smarter but boring and conventional wife  along with the idiotic sidekick for  comic  relief it sorely needs it stale predictable jokes  with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack  punctuate this noxious mental narcotic s nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill  or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma  but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a personage to which they can truly identify a  regular  guy just like you and me i live in the southern u s  so to me this show is just the opposite of escapism down here  that obnoxious character is everywhere  in some form or another seeing him on television is brutal overkill',-1

'there are two reasons why i did not give a   to this movie  one reason are some of the actors  like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh  work  who tried to play at their usually good level of acting  however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg  which is quite different to most other such roles i ve seen so far everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be  boring scenes  useless and boring dialogs  bad script work  and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors  it could have been an interesting story though  but they failed completely',-1

'curiosity led me to this  masterpiece   unfortunately  i didn t rent it  i bought it  the most disturbing thing about this film is that it s not so disturbing  for reasons known only to them  the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer  are you kidding me  the man gave new meaning to the term  finger lickin  good   and with all the flash backs and flash forwards i had trouble following the story  all in all jeremy renner s performance wasn t too bad  you can catch him in  s w a t    in which he plays a disgruntled ex cop  anyway  i would rate this as a       it only got a   because of renner s so so performance  there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer s crimes  avoid this one',-1

'way to go ace  you just made a chilling  grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft  mellow  drama  obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds  horror  or documentary right  this was neither  it wasn t close to any detailed facts   in fact it barely had any substance at all  it wasn t really morbid or scary or didn t even try to be very disturbing  as if you would ve had to try    what the hell was this writer director thinking   here s one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot  poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent s house  i think jacobson was actually trying to present  or invent   the soft side  of j dahmer',-1

'this movie had so much potential  anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it s ridiculous  too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer s homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption  where was the character development  the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception  where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals  instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer  but fail to address the major point in dahmer s development  also  the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details   how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this  his cannibalism and his desire for flesh  etc  i could go on  but to sum up  too many lagging points in the film  focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore   the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is  dahmer',-1

'prior to watching  dahmer   i thought no movie could be worse than  freddy got fingered   i was wrong  to sum  dahmer  up  it s a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of dahmer s encounters with gay men before they were killed  there is no plot to be found  and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about  dahmer   all you ll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men  horrible acting  horrible directing  horrible writing  horrible everything    if you have to choose between watching  dahmer  and projectile vomiting for three hours  go with the vomiting      it wll be less painful',-1

'while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing  i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery  perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age  the movie was made  as it is now       an official five years ago   after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings  and science fiction feats like star wars  as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer s the odyssey my beef  basically  is that i couldn t relate   i am just about the same age of the children  a young adult   and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle aged man if that is the character available  but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence  i didn t find myself saying  ack  i would have done the same thing    it did not open the doors to my imagination  even without comparing it to high budget films or other tv movies  standing alone  certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche  the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking  seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish teenager bitter after divorce image changing into the we re a big happy family let s never separate again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run  even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement  a typical set of one or the other stereotypes  there was the ever present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious  accompanied by mr  perfect image of combining athletics  good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude  and lastly the smart aleck little brother we find to be so common these days  while i know the personalities pushed the story along  i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable   and believable  as far as character    movie i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design   that made it worth finishing to the end for me  don t get me wrong  all movies are worth seeing for yourself  and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many  but i think that with a little more depth to the script  and a little more  i cannot believe i am saying this  realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical',-1

'i know it s a power rangers gimmick and catered to   year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie  if they are going to write a plot with crayons  at least have the decency to make it silly  it s kind of hilarious if you watch this  we have a typical family filled with cliched characters  father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol   air head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting  and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space  funny stuff however  the real great moment comes near the end when war dad and bad acting villain try to work a sword fight  but then they realize none of them know how to  probably because no room in budget for choreographers   so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in  lol      rating because they try to treat this seriously',-1

'fairly good movie  but not a true story rubin  hurricane  carter was a notorius liar  a murder and was never found not guilty  new jersey state just didn t go for it a third time as    years had gone  carter got an offer in        pass a lie test and go free   he didn t take it  this film should never have been made  but money talks  a lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white  why choose a fake story jens',-1

'a dreary and pointless bit of fluff  bloody fluff  but fluff   badly scripted  with inane and wooden dialogue  you do not care if the characters  indeed  even if the actors themselves  live or die  little grace or charm  little action  little point to the whole thing  perhaps some of the set and setting will interest  those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived  the framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting  and the hoppalong cassidy character himself is both boring and inept',-1

'this movie looks like it was made for tv   for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter  because i loved to see him box at the old msg  and to see this movie was very disappointing i have alot of respect for mr washington  but he was awful and boring there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song',-1

'denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie  someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie  giving away most of the story line in about the first   minutes  that and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before so first it confuses you and then it puts you off  the dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers  granted  it does that so if you are looking for that     knock yourself out',-1

'if this movie was about a fictional character  the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively  unfortunately for the viewer  the movie is based on  facts  that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter  many of the smaller facts were disregarded  carter was not number one contender at the time of the murders  there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth   but some of the larger facts  like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of  racist  judges  is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape  and completely disrespectful to giardello  why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who  at best  was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be  was arrested multiple times for beating women  is strange to me  ruben carter was never  by viewing his actions in the    s and even now  when he refuses to speak to his son  a person that people can look up to  everyone knows that jewison can direct  and washington can act  but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me  is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable   heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself  now thats inspirational  based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie  i would suggest passing on this one',-1

'this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with  saw it    years ago as an adolescent  stayed up late to do so  was very annoyed to find that it was about     romance    everything else     history if that  it s what i call a bait and switch movie  one with an interesting title  the actual movie is a scam  this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment  this movie is almost an insult to those who served  the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes  they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france  and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter s character  flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls  an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn t have lasted two days  it would have either been the stockade or the infantry  discipline in the french army was often rather fierce  in short  another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment',-1

'this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii  i was under ten years of age  and that s the audience this serial is designed for  looking at it now  one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity  the budget must have been next to nothing  given the shortcuts and repeats  the acting  well  this is republic pictures        they read the lines    and no doubt had one take to make them convincing one and half stars',-1

'like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film  especially the  film makers were then attacked  aspect that the case seems to emphasize  what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob then  to watch the film and discover  oh  what they mean by  the film makers were attacked  was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said  someone should beat those two kids up   the picture on the cover   the chase  as it were  total fabrication  which i guess ties in with the theme of the film  lying and manipulation to satisfy vain  stupid children with more money and time then sense i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film  it s like michael moore s  roger   me   but if  roger   me  was moore mocking the people of flint  it s completely misdirected and totally inane  wow  can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food  what jerks  and it s not so much   look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah   since it wasn t just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors  it was that  as many people in the film say  the prices were absurdly low  someone mentions that they should ve known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck  that s not proving anything except that people who are poor  will go to a store that has low prices  bravo fellas  way to stick it to the people on the bottom way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people  you should be very proud  how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then  say   haha  no such house exists  your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media   morgan  please like me  spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it s no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him avoid like the plague',-1

'this is almost certainly the worst western i ve ever seen  the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films    hero learns that family friends have been murdered  so hero sets out to exact revenge  foils the ineffective lawman  rescues the kidnapped loving damsel  and murders the expert arch nemesis in a brutal duel  this formula has often been successful    otherwise it wouldn t be a formula    but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you ll ever see  the scripting is atrociously simple minded and insulting  it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth  maturity  and realism  the sound is bad  it sometimes looks dubbed  the cinematography is lame  and the sets are sometimes just facades  the acting is pitiful  sure  some of the performers could blame the script  but others cannot use that excuse  i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again  every time he says a line that should be angry or mean  he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho  and speaking of chris lybbert  who plays hopalong  check out his duds  if you dare to watch this film   he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard working  down and dirty cowboy  if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy  then get this  but if you have more than two neurons  watch something else',-1

'i have this film out of the library right now and i haven t finished watching it  it is so bad i am in disbelief  audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then  although she d pretty much finished with it in  robin and marian   this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film  it s really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies  little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest  palest shadow who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in  breakfast at tiffany s  twenty years earlier  the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious  you sure don t have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you  reverting to type  means going back up as well as going back down  i guess  in this case  audrey hepburn s chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star  here she has even lost her talent as a star  if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period  like ann margret  had played the role  there would have been some life in it  even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid level situations hepburn was a great person  of course  greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being  and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors  after this dreadful performance  she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called  love among thieves   in  they all laughed  it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her    s  even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn  turner took acting seriously even when she was bad  hepburn doesn t take it seriously at all  couldn t be bothered with it  even her hair and clothes look tacky  her last really good work was in  two for the road   perhaps her most perfect  if possibly not her best in many ways and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening  john ritter is horrible  there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten  who was truly pretty  otherwise  critic david thomson s oft used phrase  losing his her talent  never has made more sense ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then  and so we have   films with gazarra and hepburn  who could ask for anything less  sandra dee s last  pitiful film  lost   from   years later  a low budget nothing  had more to it than this  at least ms  dee spoke in her own voice  by       audrey hepburn s accent just sounded silly  she d go on to do the pbs  gardens of the world with audrey hepburn  and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about  what i like most is when flowers go back to nature   as in naturalized daffodils  but in an actual fictional movie  she just sounds ridiculous to think that  breakfast at tiffany s  was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world  she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in  my fair lady   matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in  last year at marienbad   and then this  and her final brief role as the angel  hap  in the spielberg film  always  was just more of the lady stuff  corny  witless and stifling i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church  a beautiful service which included a boys  choir singing the shaker hymn  simple gifts   the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburn s singing  moon river  on the fire escape in  breakfast at tiffany s   and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation a great lady who was once a fine actress  as in  the nun s story   and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the    s and    s who became a truly bad one  that s not all that common  and perhaps it is only a great human being who  in making such things as film performances trivial  nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly  which all of her late film work contained in abundance  most of the talk about hepburn s miscasting is about  my fair lady   but the one that should have had the original actress in it was  wait until dark   which had starred lee remick on broadway  never as celebrated as hepburn  she was a better actress in many ways  hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid   although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part  after that  all of her acting went downhill',-1

'ok  so i just saw the movie  although it appeared last year    i thought that it was generally a decent movie  except for the storyline  which was stupid and horrible    first of all  we never get to know anything about the creatures  why they appeared  wtf are they doing in our world  and really  have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space  secondly  the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created    really  how large could the underground for a sub station could have been  there were only so many of those creatures  so i think instead of killing innocent people in vain  they could have just planted some tactical bombs  or maybe clear the are and a nuke would have done the job  i know it sounds funny and it is  but i do not see the killing of people as being necessary    thirdly  leon acts like superman jumping on the train and fighting vinnie jones  who was way taller and bigger in stature  then again  when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp  watching all the abominations  i mean ok  the conductor had creepy help lol   but if leon was so brave he would have gone all the way    i mean he risks his life first  then does nothing exactly when he should have  he could have died as a hero but lives as a coward    this might be the case  but not after showing so much braveness earlier on    then  the cop thing    come on  this was a city having a subway  i bet there must have been other cops except that lady  other police stations this was really kind of silly    all in all  great acting by vinnie jones  interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all    by the way  what did the signs on the chest mean  vinnie jones cannot make up for the rest',-1

'i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made  if you doubt me  please look at my other reviews  however  for the first time ever  i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over i love bad movies  to me  ed wood is a genius  i thought bloody murder  jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good  however  there is not a single good thing i can say about this film the plot is basically non existent  if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it  they can discern for themselves what the plot might be  but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie the special effects are bad the acting is bad the two leads are attractive  but that s all there is i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone  but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarking yahoo com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it  i will tell you anything i love bad movies  and i love horror and i love new inventive movies  i even love horror porn stuff like hostel  which some reviewers claimed this was like  but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel     but this may be the number   most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made and before you disregard this review  this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead  but actually bought a copy of it',-1

'i have heard a lot about this film  with people writing me telling me i should see it  as i am a fan of extremely bloody  gory movies  i got my hands on it almost right away  but one thing or another always kept me from watching it  until now  i would have been better off not remembering i even had it this movie was atrocious  the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was  i know it was a story by clive barker and all  and no i have not read that story  but it appears to me that if you haven t then you will be  as i was  completely clueless and utterly disappointed the film begins good enough  the actors are convincing  the story interesting  the first scene is bloody  a great way to catch your attention  i thought the blood looked a bit bad  but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on  i was wrong the blood and effects are so horrible  it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that  for instance  someone could knock a person s head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer  wtf  cgi blood  did they even use any  real  blood at all  my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film    unbelievable acts of dismemberment  eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head  arms cut neatly off  does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies     too dark scenes  every scene is either an odd yellow color  or in hidden in shadows    it just gets worse and worse  i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake  there s just too much  add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial killer movie turns into some demonic supernatural monster movie at the end   no thank you  it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway  ok  with a conspiracy theory thrown in  and an overzealous photographer  maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant  plausible  doable   and a lot better i think than the  real  story  that could have and should have worked  instead it became a  creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you  and unless you read the book  well   you just won t ever understand it  fiasco  tragic  what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential  if you like mindless fake blood and gore  you ll love this  but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it  stay away  far  far away',-1

'this was a terrible film  there was no story line whatsoever  to top it all off  when they couldn t explain the blood and gore  the only good part      they threw in a few aliens  i hate when directors  or whatever  run out of ideas and then blame the aliens  watch this film if you like  but don t say i didn t warn you  two things  how could vinny say  welcome  when he didn t have a tongue  its a pity mr jones didn t have a bigger role  second thing that bugged me  why were we shown vinny jones  boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid  then these have no further role  why not  i don t like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever  in short  bad story  i wouldn t waste my time   wish i d have watched mirrors instead',-1

'where to start  the film started out pretty well  but after the    min mark i caught myself watching the clock  the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in  it just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by the actors gave an average performance in this movie however  i got a bit bored of vinny jones constant scowling in the film as the film dragged on  and take my word for it  it dragged on  it just got more and more far fetched     spoiler alert     spoiler alert     spoiler alert     just when i thought the film could not get any worse  towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up  just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all  it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end  the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was  once the lead role disposes of vinny jones  he becomes the new killer in closing  this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made  i gave it   star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie',-1

'you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of  jeopardy   the saddest thing about white men can t jump is that it had tremendous potential  for several years  i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film  racial tensions were high  and basketball meant everything to everyone  a film about the members of this  basketball culture  could have been very interesting  but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men can t job left something to be desired the movie s sequence of events is cyclical  first  billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball  he then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend  and the process is repeated  most stories build up to a climax of some kind  but the  climax  i saw was just another sequence in this repetition  this case being  billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball   in order for a plot to develop  some dilemma must be resolved  and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well  apparently the writers of white men can t jump forgot this rule  as the plot can be summarized as  billy needs to pay the bills   i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies  but    i m sorry    this was just plain awful  i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment despite all this  white men can t jump is a successful film  apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them  others  i m sure  were lured by the big names playing the leading roles  this leaves me to wonder  if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors  and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse  would anyone have bothered watching this movie  i really don t think so i ll give this movie two stars out of ten  the extra star is for the  jeopardy   scene  which kept me awake for a few minutes  thanks  trebek',-1

'i really can t understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than   star    how can you like such a retarded film  where all the animal abuse scenes are real  i don t even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments    jesus    what kind of   human   would torture them like that for no reason  or just for money  i tell you  that director is either mentally retarded  or he s just a monster with a   heart   of stone  or both  he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive it contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock  especially to sensitive persons and children  a real frog is skinned alive  fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water  a dog is beaten  birds are thrown into the water   this movie is more than awful  it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made  along with another one  called   cannibal holocaust   or something like that  i ll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster  no one should waste their time watching it  especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there  in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged fortunately  only a few people liked this   which is natural  since it s the worst film ever    so it wasn t successful  i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised  and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films  i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give  there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel   humans   will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others this  however  is probably my only   negative   review  i usually don t comment on a movie if i dislike it  but this time i just couldn t shut up  i had to speak the truth  because animal abuse must stop',-1

'is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant  life spanning testimonial of  spring  summer  fall  winter and spring   the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite  nearly silent  heartbreaking longing of    iron   the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of  the coast guard  and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all  characters and viewers alike  to experience redemption in  samaritan girl   i just cannot seem to find him in this film oh  sure  kim s nature motif is still present  the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters  yes  it s kim ki duk  all right  kim even describes the film as  beautiful  in an interview included in the dvd s special features  but i m not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation what is beautiful about angry  potty mouthed prostitutes  lustful  violent and potty mouthed fishermen  a covetous mute merchant  explicit animal torture  sequences of self mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality  these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film  if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater  this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material  it has been favorably compared to  audition  by japanese director takashi miike  much to kim s satisfaction   but aside from some astonishingly good performances  especially given what they had to work with  by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk  i find little reason to recommend this film  i have not seen  audition   but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of  the isle   its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic  its sex is not pornographic  but passionless and masochistic  characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot  its point is either non existent or  i will admit  lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand the only beauty is in the cinematography  which is classic kim  fog shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake  mountainous terrain dominating the background  and an imaginative and playful use of color  at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room  some touches  like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes  are intriguing  but as a film  this effort is downright confusing and  in the end  offensive to the senses  not necessarily to sensibilities  one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film making in the trash heap of his past  for we know he is capable of so much more',-1

'i generally don t give worry much about violence in films  or a vast amount of philosophy  symbolism or psychology  all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us  there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature  a good setting of characters  a good direction  this film could be voted for as a good film  however  it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film  not movie violence  i am talking about real violence  this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two  the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women  not that we all don t have some real twists with women  respectively men   but the conclusion of the film ruins it all  spoiler  our  heroine  finally dies   by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it enraged me  now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon  nature growing over her  in particular her sex   of course it is the director who  kills  the women heroine  women have to die  especially if men are attracted by their sexuality  that seems to be the final conclusion   end spoiler well  well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself  but to use big pictures  artsy directions cruelty to living creatures  just to say men can be frightened of women  and men are cruel to women  thats just not enough  i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the  philosophical  eastern and artistic  and whatever approach  but to me this film is just totally marred',-1

'of all the movies i ve seen  this one rates almost at the bottom  haunted mansion  nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom   it is hasty  the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted  of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer s door  the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous  and illogical  oprah gives a palatable appearance as  bigger s  mom  but is not nearly at her potential  other famous performers also seem to be at their worst  the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur  in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted  one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk  now the family he s working for are not against blacks  but he thinks they are  so when he comes home he puts her to bed  but she begins caterwauling  the blind mother  yes  hears this  so bigger tries to silence her  but instead smothers her  now fearing he s really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do  he shoves her into the coal furnace  so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace  the idiot didn t have the foresight to get rid of the ashes  he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom  if your desperate for a bad movie  this one could do the job  but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th    s and    s or see a good drama  there are a lot better options  avoid this',-1

'as good an advert for republicanism as you re ever likely to see  mayerling is an everyday story of royal folk in late nineteenth century austria set during one of europe s seemingly incessant internal turmoils it concerns itself with the emperor franz joseph  mr james mason  his rebellious son the crown prince rudolf  mr omar sharif the empress miss ava gardner  and various mistresses secret policemen spies extravagantly uniformed popinjays gypsies dancers wives  soldiers swans horses and the bizarre inbred web of european royalty at the time of franz joseph s austro hungarian empire  filmed in what the old movie posters used to call  a riot of color  it resembles nothing more than an expensively dressed but intellectually challenged production of  the student prince   mr james mason wearing a very natty little white number utilises his all purpose mittel european accent whenever he remembers i am a great admirer of his and i sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing  mr omar sharif who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the crown prince he is utterly unconvincing as a man who  in the movie at least cut a swathe through the distaff side of the austrian aristocracy with his well buttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms as a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes unhappily married he falls in love with a commoner  forbidden love  is one of the movie s come ons as she is played by the most uncommon miss catherine deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there miss deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it particularly in the sequence set at the ballet  now i love ballet as much as the next man but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time a more cynical critic might consider it to be  padding   rudolf s mother the empress is played by miss ava gardner she gives the part some good old american oooomph making her a bit like  auntie mame  but it s done with undeniable style rudolf is certainly very fond of his mother   i ll put it no more strongly than that  the only performance worth watching is that of mr james robertson justice as sir lancelot spratt   sorry edward prince of wales he is so wonderfully unconcerned about everything going on around him it s a joy to behold i waited vainly for him to ask rudolf the immortal question  what s the bleeding time    i am not qualified to dispute  mayerling   s historical accuracy but in my opinion everything else about it is risible  it is a ruritanian opera buffa without the tunes to send you home from the theatre whistling',-1

'i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit  the script and dialogue is laughable  the acting was awful  where did they get them from  music was ok i have to say  luckily i didn t buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger  martin sheen  started to tell his story  i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex s finger off and told him to practise for    years to reach his league  but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter  i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better  never did',-1

'this is a very cheaply made werewolf flick  the video is dark and poorly lit  the audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed  the script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun   filled of course with silver bullets   the acting is as wooden as the characters  the fx are non existent lots of extreme close ups of werewolf jaws and biting  the only thing that is shown is lots of soft core t a   instead of dropping     for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic   dog soldiers  with sean pertwee',-1

'what more can i say  the acting was  almost without exception  amateurish  the directing and continuity were pitiful  the sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious  one of the features on the dvd was labeled  gag reel  but that could have been a description of a viewer s reaction to most of the movie one of the most amusing things was in the director s comments on the dvd  he said  with a straight face  that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast   and that he had succeeded  with delusions like that it s easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster  the darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit  per the  making of  feature on the dvd  and rather looked it  the mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store  the cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game',-1

'let me start by saying that i d read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect  still  i was surprised by just how bad it was i am a big werewolf fan  and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one  most of them have sub par effects  poor acting  and weak storylines  at best rehashed from earlier films   so far  with the possible exception of some of the later  howling  series films  this is the worst of the lot first  the story  it s been quoted several times in reviews on this site  so i won t go into specifics  however  it is very obvious that the writer s  had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters  as so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves  above  such fare  they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos  that s fine  but a non horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them  the plot feels like a parody of werewolf films  and the events depicted just ring so false that i felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted  tv news footage  for example  never pans away from the reporter to close up on someone in the crowd behind them  give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign  and that s just the tip of the iceberg as for effects  i have never seen a less believable werewolf  i d have been happier with lon chaney jr  in crepe hair  the beast they used look a great deal like    well  like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics  and  i know that many people have already criticized the cg  but my god it was awful  one scene features a woman changing  and starts with a completely cg version of the actress  nude but for some reason without nipples  my first thought was   hey  why is one of the characters from  reboot  turning into a silly looking werewolf  anyway  i like to look for positives in any film  and there were a few  the cinematography was passable  the film was shot all digital  which is interesting  and some of the performances were not terrible  it was also interesting seeing tippi hedron as the world s most well made up homeless woman  and kane hodder as the title bad guy  also  the yellow power ranger got all growed up and    well  damn  and if you re looking for skin  there s some pretty tasty examples  this ends the male pig segment of the review overall  if you want a good werewolf film  try  an american werewolf in london   the original  the howling    dog soldiers   or even  the wolfen   though that one s got more wolf than were   if you re a lycanthrope completest  then take a gander  otherwise  give this one a miss',-1

'there isn t much to say about this film  it is horrible the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent  the story of the hybrid werewolf s is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there cgi is something you wouldn t like to see  it so amateurish that it makes me vomit the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras  the gag reel  everything else  just waste of time and money  i hope noone will buy this  this is not even worth renting just stay away of this',-1

'man  this movie sucked big time  i didn t even manage to see the hole thing  my girlfriend did though   really bad acting  computer animations so bad you just laugh  woman to werewolf   strange clips  the list goes on and on  don t know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie  and i don t mean all the naked ladys    it s something about the light or something    this could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women  but not because it s an original movie white a nice plot twist  my final words are  don t see it  it s not worth the time  if you wanna see it because the nakedness there s lots of better ones to see',-1

'hi  i m a friend of werewolf movies  and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like  hmm  simple and nice name to it at least  althou    i wonder why i haven t heard of it before  first of all  the movie starts with tits  lots of tits  tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to  who cares about a werewolf effect  just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots so  about the mysterious darkwolf character  a little spoilers ahead  but who really cares     he s your average everyday biker  not even super tough looking  but like the old wise woman says in the movie  he is far more powerful and dangerous than you ve ever faced before   just by describing her a tattooed biker type of a guy  pretty original  i even had look twice when they first used the  red glowing eyes  special effect  i mean my god  that  lets plant red dots on eyes with computer  effect has been used since the seventies  it looks plain ugly here  and don t get me started with the werewolf  d cgi  as said before  like an bad and old video game and finally  as i do like werewolf films  like i said  they prettymuch always build a werewolf legend of their own  darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well  about some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient bloodline  but  it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement  the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched  starts random slashing  which just doesn t make any sense  why even bother telling us the rules of killing  when they aren t even gonna play by them    aplus the wolf point of view shots are made with a sony handycam or something  filming mostly the floor and walls  just add growling noises and you ve got a super werewolf effect  the gore is partially ok  but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand  just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims  it just doesn t do the trick for me   truly  who gives money to make these heaps of junk straight to video horrortitles  they aren t even funny kind of bad movies  just sad',-1

'this flick reminded me of those lame  erotic thrillers  i used to stay up late and watch on cinemax when i was     i d label this flick softer core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder  there is  however  a ton of nudity  the opening scene is in a strip club  we see kane hodder s keester  or at least a stunt butt  and then an inexplicable    minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the munster s for a costume     year old boys rejoice other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi i ve seen in years  the shots look like fmv s from the video game resident evil in terms of quality  the wolf is too bad to be explained and  despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way  way too many times the plot and acting make no sense  there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves  the darkwolf is the latter but from what i can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do  look human  change to a wolf an kill people  the darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can t find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches  once more  this skills proves less than useful since the darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched  met or even saw as best i can tell  the mate doesn t know she s a werewolf and she s fighting the transformation or something you d think it d be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but  well they did  want quality low end werewolf ism  go rent dog soldiers want a ton of t a  this is your flick',-1

'another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story  within    minutes  the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines  so there is absolutely no mystery  which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense  the only half way competent actor is killed    minutes into the film  so we re left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things  low budget films can t afford expensive special effects  so the cgi portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive  but were at least a valid attempt  the creature suit is terrible  as seen when it falls to the sidewalk  and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes  which aren t even the red color shown in mirror shots  the dialogue is clumsy and uninspired  with some lines reminiscent of aliens or terminator  the last action sequence takes place in a police station  also a rip off from terminator  with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the darkwolf doesn t smash into  in the end  the girl calls the hero  a good protector   but he gets both his partners  the original protector  and at least three other civilians  not to mention a dozen cops  all killed without getting a decent shot off  in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun  but here s the real clincher for bad writing  they could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes  instead  they took it into custody',-1

'this move was on tv last night  i guess as a time filler  because it sucked bad  the movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way   not bad tits and ass though   but the story is too ridiculous for words  the  wolf   if that is what you can call it  is hardly shown fully save his teeth  when it is fully in view  you can clearly see they had some interns working on the cgi  because the wolf runs like he s running in a treadmill  and the cgi fur looks like it s been waxed  all shiny   the movie is full of gore and blood  and you can easily spot who is going to get killed slashed eaten next  even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed  they didn t do a good job at it don t even get me started on the actors    very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every   seconds  but then again  if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks  then hey  where do i sign up overall boring and laughable horror',-1

'the only reason i even watched this was because i found it at my local library  and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it   and despite the plethora of tits and ass  it didn t take long to realize that the fast forward button was my friend  terrible direction  pedestrian camera work  sporadically bad to nearly passable acting  chintzy effects  and one of the worst screenplays i ve had the displeasure of seeing brought to life  such as it was  horribly crippled and mutilated  in a long  long time  best laughs actually come from the  making of     featurette  in which the poor saps involved with this hdv mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special  instead of something that won t be utterly forgotten next week  wait  except for the fact that somehow someone lured tippi  the birds  hedren  of all people  into doing a bit part  along with kane  friday the   th  hodder  how this came to pass  i ll never know  and to be honest  i don t really care  watch at your own risk  and don t say you haven t been warned  this is film making at its pretentious  craven worst  it only gets a   from me for having some good looking naked women  and even then  just barely',-1

'dark wolf  quick review  let s get right to it  this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh t on it  it s just an awful movie  it s an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an    s high school drama film  what s worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf  kane f cking hodder  someone s trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career   anyway  former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf  too  it s kind of a crappy cop drama with the world s worst looking werewolf in it  but it does have moments of near rampant nudity  but that s about all  want to know more  okay  the werewolf is generally an ugly looking black blur zipping around the screen  and when we re privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence  we re presented with something that resembles a full motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation  the first playstation  the cg animation is really that primitive  only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit      www residenthazard com',-1

'this kind of  inspirational  saccharine is enough to make you sick  it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth  it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it  the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car  i guess you d need such prompting to feel if you re stupid enough to watch a film as simple minded and sappy as this  streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it s just that   a display  switched on and off like a light  because i can t for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film  even though it s based on a true story  and an inspirational one at that i m sure  the set up  execution and performances play like a third rate tv movie or half witted high school drama',-1

'we loved school of rock and jack black  we couldn t wait to go and see this movie  it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out  my husband hated it too  the only funny parts were in the trailers  my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money  the writing was awful  it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended  the movie wasn t that long but to us it seemed like an eternity  the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry  i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts  but there weren t  save you money and your time',-1

'what a disappointment this film seemed to be trying to copy  cutting edge  comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy  sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition  jack black s acting role was self indulgent and self regarding    and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting  the soundtrack was tedious  we are   were  fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration  why did he feel he needed to make this mistake we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first  was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel',-1

'i mean  really    either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie  it s stupid  ridiculous and just not funny at all since i saw the preview i knew it wasn t going to be a great movie  i just didn t think it was gonna be that bad   what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie  when the actors didn t have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny   now we find ourselves with movies like this one  borat  little men  scary movie   where i could not find the funny parts  just skip this piece of garbagep s   sorry for my english',-1

'jack black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing  but in this movie   besides the direction  writing  lack of plot  constant mugging  aided and abetted by constant straight on camera shots   and a      joke batting average  it was still an utter waste of time  the idea sounds promising  but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction i ve seen this side of you tube i kept hearing that this film portrayed mexicans very negatively  while that s no doubt true  i really don t think this movie is meant to be racist  i think that s it s more a result of a  creative  team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess  you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera   hey look  it s an ugly mexican  laugh  people  please  for the love of all things tenacious  laugh  but put the racism charges aside  when you get down to it  it s anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended  imo',-1

'saw this movie in an early preview  and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was  from the very beginning  the audience was groaning over pacino s awful southern accent  poor al looked really  really haggard  and i can t decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist  or perhaps he just didn t get any sleep before coming to the set  much worse than pacino s close ups  however  is the wretched excuse for a plot  early in the film we are given indications that pacino s character is gay  and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended  later  however  we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger  both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles  lust after this elderly  half dead looking  effeminate man with the ridiculous accent  the worst part overall was the main plot thread  which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never  ever care about in the slightest  because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment  because of the possibility of re shoots and editing  but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters',-1

'this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about  gigli   that ben and jen flop earlier this summer   the order  was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes  rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film  appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot  now  i m a heath ledger fan      things i hate about you    a knight s tale  and particularly his supporting role in  monster s ball    but my man needs to find himself a better agent  keep accepting scripts like  the order  and  four feathers  and he s going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion here are the problems i had with the film  firstly  the director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with  well  much of anything  plot skeins involving the american trying to take over the vatican and the dark pope  while mildly interesting  did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters  the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best  secondly  please don t insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory  we had manufactured angst  manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of  matrix reloaded  with skull numbing techno music  rather than developing character  these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were  a half hearted attempt at putting popcorn chewing adolescents in the seats  thirdly  and most importantly  this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept  we have scandal  we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play  why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone s background  we learn a little about alex  but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days  a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past  and alex is the most developed  if you can call it that  character in the entire film as the cliche goes nowadays  if you re going to see one movie this year  make sure it s not this one  there s about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable     minute affair  the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who i m rather fond of   out of     i m disappointed  file this one firmly under  had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing   heath my man  go back to monster s ball like cameos  they really suit you',-1

'potential spoilers  man  this movie was awful  a catholic superstitious suspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous movies the doubting priest  sex and the priesthood  politics and religion  church hypocrisy  conspiracy involving the church  the dawn of a new evil age  all kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice  the story revolves around two concepts  absolution  better known as the sacrament of anointing the sick   the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse one s sins while on the brink of death  and excommunication  the act of cutting a person off from the church  basically  an excommunicated person can t receive absolution  thus comes in the sin eater  and i ll leave it at that  throw in all the dopy things i already listed and you have  the order  i found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to catholics  it also ends with heath ledger saying  i paraphrase   i am the redeemer and damner of sins  i live on without love blah blah blah   cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla  the matrix  i gave this movie a   for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process  if you want to see something better i suggest  the prophecy  with christopher walken',-1

'yeah  well  i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little  yet very long  movie  apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life  here s the epitome of the antihero in  no regrets   we have this jerk  so messed up  so wandering  so selfish  aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman s up and coming son  jaemin  unless it was just that  physical attraction  he claims otherwise  that it s love  but after watching this  it s like loving charles manson because you dig the beard   alright  he s not that bad  but still no real redeemable characteristics   i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin  it was never shown  just told  that jaemin loves sumin  perhaps it s a culture thing that flew over my head  crazy stalking   mad love over in seoul  it has to be  because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy  i was waiting for a tiger named  baby  to make an appearance  okay  so sumin works two jobs while going to school  so far so good on someone trying to better themselves  but after his first taste of his stalker s attraction  he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring  what  ok  well  as previously mentioned  the obsession doesn t stop due to the job career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup  basic movie  not      terrible  but you can do better with foreign gay themed movies',-1

'no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser s flashman papers than i am i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash  since i also see he had made the three four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well not so royal flash i was    years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time  and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel  i still am  but he was never really given a chance after that  what a disappointment  i saw it once again when i was about    on television and it seemed even worse  none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen  the comedy of flashman s character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do  the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic looking back with more mature eyes  the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda if you have read the book and not seen the film  i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented  russian roulette a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently  but i am glad i have not if by any chance fraser ever reads this  i can only say i think he is a genius  perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation  but  based on my appreciation of that corpus of work  it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film  as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films',-1

'i saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go  this movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next the  th man is about an alcoholic writer named reve  who has visions of his in pending danger  he meets up with a woman named christine when giving a lecture at a local book club  and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is  to put it plainer  reve likes the dutch sausage  so reve concocts a plan to seduce christine s boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him  but its later discovered that christine has had   previous husbands  who she all murdered  now reve and christine s boyfriend could be  the  th man   the storyline makes sense with no plot holes  the editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine  the movie is just gross and i felt the need to vomit in some parts  basically  this isn t my cup of tea the movie opens with reve getting out of bed in just a t shirt  so in the very beginning  you get to see reve s lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state  later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors  and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues  reve fondles a statue of jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum  plus there s a lot of blood  more blood than all the freddy krueger movies combined not that i have anything against  shocking  scenes  but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking  the whole movie is revolved around the shock value so if any of this is your cup of tea  watch this movie  otherwise  stay far far far far far away from this one  my mind is still scarred',-1

'i read john everingham s story years ago in reader s digest  and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make  and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it  as far as i m concerned  landon was one of the worst actors on earth  and his artistic license went way over the top  similar to his massacre of the  little house  book series is proof  the acting  for lack of a better word  is atrocious  the screenplay sloppy  and there are more close ups of landon s puss than should be allowed this movie reflects everingham s story as much as  little house on the prairie  reflects the books is was  based  on  it s just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair',-1

'there is so much that is wrong with this film  but to sum it up  terrible acting  so bad it must have been on purpose  poor script   they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story  ridiculously bad ending  in some cases the ending manages to save the film not in this case  if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for  this is the worst film i have seen in a long time  it was complete torture sitting through this film  i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance  so do yourself a favor  watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do  even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture',-1

'the premise of this movie was decent enough  but with sub par acting  it was just bland and dull spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death  it was accidental  so although it was a murder it wasn t like the guy set out to do it  also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree  there is no emotion in this film  the first    minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister  and hearing her message  it was dull and boring with some polishing  and better acting it could have been pretty good',-1

'okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a         budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed  plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn t you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her  and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her  proof   i don t know i was not happy with the ending  this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad  do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy',-1

'this movie isn t worth the film it was photographed on  the dialog is flat  filled with clich overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time  the choppy  shaky  film style is a cheap imitation of the  the ring  style visual effects  the characters do not even act like a normal person would  for example  the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door  creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn t even once call out her sister s name to see if she is home  what  you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her  way too many flashbacks to her childhood  too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director  it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street  up the driveway  around this corner  over here  over there  oh a side view  now a front view  enough already  you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the solaris  terrible movie    out of      i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it',-1

'for a film with so much promise it was disappointing  thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable the plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it s the worst clichd ending i ve seen in a movie for some time  the final scene would have ripped my heart out  if the entire movie hadn t been so painful to begin with  i was numb  from the very first scene   one was left wondering  if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help  or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting i ve seen to date  it was a horror in the true sense of the word',-1

'i watched the movie  and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience  the language would put to shame the street loafers the plot  a father forcing none of his son to marry  seems far fetched the idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded s attention    and i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh  and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste   hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look hope it saves your time',-1

'this movie was bad beyond belief  i saw it during the      san francisco film festival  before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before  which happened to be its  world premiere   i don t think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point  we all understood by the end its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one  dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige  in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies  the movie is only    minutes long and the content of those    minutes is sub par to say the least  a scene would start going then someone would say  wow you re so great bettie  why don t we make another movie   this would be followed by a   minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as  and even more boring than  the normal part of the movie  by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up  it was that ludicrous  i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre  but people were not laughing with the movie maker  they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure  this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory i know movies are expensive  i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen  the movie looks like it was made for      the cuts  the graininess  and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience  this movie makes  dude  where s my car   look like citizen kane my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid   dollars to be tortured  the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good  apparently  the previous night  the night of the  world premiere  the director writer producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie  bettie paige s movies were destroyed  they should destroy this movie too',-1

'they made me watch this in school and it was terrible  the movie is outdated  the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors  but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life this accounts for cheesy acting very often  also  very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far fetched  i don t like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them  though  it was written to be educational  funny  suspenseful  and hip  it ended up being boring  dry  far fetched  and old  i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it',-1

'the acting is some of the worst i ve ever seen  the characters are totally unconvincing  this could be overlooked to some extent if the plot was interesting  which the plot to  the prodigy  was not  it s sort of a bad mix between  fresh  and  animal house   except that both of those movies were good',-1

'in sixth grade  every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester  every class had something to do with this terrible show  we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters  in math we talked about charts and other sea crap  in science we talked about whales  which was actually somewhat interesting  so this wasn t a      waste of time   all day everyday was torture  not only that  but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well  i could see if this was a new series or something  but it was  like       i m still trying to block this out',-1

'it is so sad  even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake  there s nothing out there     the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i ve ever heard  i like the brother and sister in this movie  they both don t try very hard to sound sarcastic when they re saying stuff like  my friends are going to be so jealous   hey  whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning  thats retarded  i practically ignored the second half of this  my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe  the same exact sound for every chop',-1

'as far as i can tell you  in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors  this film is currently available on dvd  i found it only a few weeks ago it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of    cents plus tax for it  i found it at a    cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks  now don t you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had    i thought so this film was indeed well worth    cents     cents  i might start to argue with you  but clearly worth    cents  and remember that saying about getting what you pay for  for slasher film mavens only',-1

'as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie  but  what a disappointment  although the acting and the production values aren t bad  the script is awful  the plot is unrealistic  and the theme is disturbing the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children  i can hardly believe how regressive it is in it s view of women  has the writer been living under a rock although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen  i wouldn t suggest this movie to anyone  it s terrible  it s an embarrassment to the city it s named after',-1

'i went to see this film with low expectations  but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film  sadly  that s about all i got  the story covers familiar territory  the high school reunion   but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well worn theme  though the quality of the acting was good overall  the content of the film was appalling  the sexism of the film was blatant  women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married  procreating or both  though this was couched as a post feminist choice    worse still was the racism  the shrill jewish mother  the black man who still lives at home   and gratuitous cruelty  tormenting the class geek   we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo  and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen',-1

'by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing  you know the type    funny but supposed to frighten you     this was not funny or horrific  the writing was lame   the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness    they were so expected  the actors didn t even do much with such a not so good script   at least i hope that wasn t their best  watch this movie at your own risk      i give it negative   stars outta',-1

'pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain  the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties  this is a horrible film in every way  imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video  they would receive a d for this  college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school  since this monstrosity was made by  professionals  i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation  i enjoy watching bad movies like  plan   from outer space  but  this thing doesn t even fall into that category  the script  acting  sound  and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable  if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood  blaxploitation  or      s horror films  after viewing this you get the feeling you ve wasted an hour and a half of your life',-1

'i didn t know it was possible to release a movie this bad  the labeling sounded so promising  but you would think that with a cast of     at least one of them would be able to act  my wife left me and went to bed after the first    minutes  she made a wise decision',-1

'if you are looking for eye candy  you may enjoy sky captain  sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers  the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie  now  saying that  the visuals are the only thing good in sky captain after ten minutes  i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time  i was hoping this movie would get better  but it never achieved any degree of interest  after thirty minutes  the urge to walk out kept growing and growing  now  i own over      movies and have seen probably five times that number  yet  this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire life acting   there is none  the three main performers are pitiful  jude law  also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on  is just awful in the title role  i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law again paltrow tries so hard to be campy  that it backfires in her face  the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting  after this performance  i would applaud that decision story   soap operas are better written  the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses directing   none  everything was put into the special effects that story  acting and directing suffer greatly  even  the phantom menace  had better acting and that is not saying a great deal i would have to give this movie a     out of       avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release',-1

'i saw this movie last month at a free sneak preview and i walked out  it was pretty horrible  in the process of trying too hard  they over acted and made a horrible movie  i was disappointed since i felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one couldn t be that far off the mark  but  i was wrong  i was hoping they would give out a survey at the end of the movie so i could tell them not to release this movie  i was lured in by the free aspect of the preview  but it turned out to be a waste of my time  and  usually  i m very easily amused  it tried to be innovative and creative with the shots  ideas and filming  but because they threw together so many ideas at once  it failed  i m not usually picky about movies and i usually don t feel the need to display my opinions about movies  but i had to warn everyone not to watch it  i registered on imdb just to tell all of you guys',-1

'in short  this movie is completely worthless the idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early     s might think of the future  an interesting idea  but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief  so the idea just flops apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed  but as a graphics person  the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening  the color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality  and i don t understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking  if anything  the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics    they don t measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics  the models for the robots were so simple  plain and very uncompelling  there were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric like animals on that island  but they are not explained in any way the story is horrible beyond belief  in fact i can t believe i didn t just walk out of this movie  the relationship between polly and joe is unmotivated  and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception  why is the morris paley character even there  we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic    i mean he flies a plane  and saved one person  polly  for personal reasons  yeah there s a great hero for you  dex has very little screen time  so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him  who were the nepalease that locked joe and polly in the mine vault  and why would they do it  remembering that the entire totenkopf operation was robotic  plot holes      why did bai ling s character  a major fall from her excellent character in  the crow   halt the robots who had captured joe  they were looking for the vials  and had not found them      why in the hell would dex be captured but not killed  he doesn t have or know about the vials  and the bad guys didn t know that polly had the vials and was connected to joe and therefore to dex       polly indicates that  they  don t know anything about totenkopf  yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbi style file on him      the blank spot on the map as described by the nepalese    if they know all about this mysterious area  then why the hell is their map blank in that spot      at one point  polly and joe have to give up their clothes  they are burned     joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes  yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress  then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes back  sigh   how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap we are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music  even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen and the acting  we re supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents  which character isn t annoying  i think ling bai s dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie  she doesn t have a single line   the dialogue wasn t camp  and doesn t even rise to the level of cheese  its just bad and annoying  these people aren t hero s or compelling  they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life i can t believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb  imho it should be competing with  batman forever  in the bottom     of all time',-1

'i entered the theater to sky captain in      expecting a good film  nearly every review of this movie had been positive  the effects looked enticing  the previews convincing needless to say  disappointment actually doesn t describe the feeling i got from this film  it was rage beyond being boring and poorly written  the reason this film gets a   out of    stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source  i understand the difference between an homage and stealing  this was stealing  more importantly  it seems that the filmmakers didn t steal to progress a point or move the plot along  they stole just to show that they could  there is literally no point to showing a clip of the wizard of oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene  that i won t elaborate on  which steals from the same film  needless to say  every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept  it was literally just a rehash of something i had already seen  from pulp era robots reminiscent of the old superman cartoons and the recent film  the iron giant   to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films  most recognizable in recent years as darth maul in  star wars  the phantom menace  on the subject of the actual film  most of the performances were completely wooden  perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a blue screen  with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors  frankly  this is no excuse for poor acting  if a person was ever a child  they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying finally  there is no humanity in this film  the protagonists are the only real human beings here  nearly all the antagonists are robots  and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand  if robots are attacking the entire planet  shouldn t we expect to see masses of humanity running from them  the sub par performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to  really  anything here the film wasn t the worst movie out there  which is why i didn t give it a    rather  the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films  the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects  but without artistic vision or originality of any kind  it falls flat',-1

'the exploding zeppelins crashing down upon  sky captain  jude law s base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is  first off  let me state right off the bat that i sincerely doubt that paramount will ever recover any money from this film  a cult hit it might become  but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve  i can see the studio pitch now   let s combine      s german expressionism and a      s globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene  wow  won t that be a success    skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess  there are too many fake explosions  too many unconvincing dogfight scenes  and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully two dimensional  after all  why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three  or five  or one hundred   moreover  what could have been a groundbreaking film  seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting  will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using cgi  quite simply  the graphics are amazingly poor  from the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights  everything seems to be just a little off  i m not being nit picky here in any way  an infant could notice that a car doesn t glide along the road like a maglev train  unless its a mercedes s      and for those of you raising your voices in protest  crying out  this is a stylized film  it s not supposed to be like reality   let me just say this  lord of the rings has set the standard for integrating real life actors with cgi  starship troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films  the rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the      s back into the hollywood film portfolio  and tim burton s batman created a unique picture of new york city gotham that has yet to be repeated  sky captain falls so short of all these films  it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence  plus  the acting is so poor  it makes me positively ill  so there you have it  i spent    to see this film and you get my review  i hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that i did',-1

'this movie was way over hyped  a lot of the viewers  who thought this was  amazing  must have been into the old school movies  cause the whole movie is set in the past  at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past  so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass  but it just going  basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past  and the   don t mix very well in this movie  even with special effects  you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with  there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did  so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying  it s the greatest movie ever done   it s just crap on a stick  it also didn t help that the story line was sooo crappy  i don t understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced  and i also don t understand how actors actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this  it s almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print    it will all be done on a computer   this was a movie that should have been on a movie network  because nothing about this movie was revolutionary  i m very upset with myself for paying money to see this  whatever you do  don t waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow',-1

'a gave it a     instead of a      awful  because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning  a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork  but that wasn t enough to save it the  sepia  toned  washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies  nothing new there  i can see there were some hat tips to other old  classic movies  ok  no problem with that but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting  not something that would put you to sleep the story line and the script of this movie was awful  the characters two dimensional  slow moving  some of the scenes were pretty to look at  but ultimately  as a whole  it was quite boring  i couldn t recommend it',-1

'the opening shot was the best thing about this movie  because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate  well crafted independent film  damn that opening shot for filling me hope  as the  film  progressed in a slow  plodding manner  my thoughts were varied in relation to this  film   was there too much butter in my popcorn  did the actors have to pay the director to be in this  film   did i get my ticket validated at the box office  yes  dear reader  i saw this film in the theatre  this would be the only exception i will make about seeing a film at home over a movie theatre  because at home you can turn it off  were there any redeeming values  peter lemongelli as the standard college  nerd  had his moments  especially in a dog collar  other than that this  film  went from trying to be a comedy  to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter  it succeeded on none of these fronts  oh  and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad  her performance was the only comedy i found',-1

'i like the time period  i like the attempt  but watching a movie that looks like i m looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache  if i played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus  i would upgrade my computer  could be that this was the look the director was after  but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after    minutes  if i hadn t taken someone with me to this film  i was out of there  even though it was a series and not a movie per say  band of brothers accomplished this  they made it look like wwii footage  with just a touch of graininess  but it was still a pleasure to watch  movies need real people  with real sets  and real locations  use cgi when it is appropriate  not for an entire film',-1

'sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i ve seen in a long while  rife with amazing cg and special effects  studded with an a list cast  jude law  gwyneth paltrow  angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi  and racing along with an overused but indiana jones esquire storyline  this should have been a great movie to watch  should have  being the key term here  of course jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over the shoulder  heart melting smirks  but you can t make something out of nothing  and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can t save the movie s stone dialogue   if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said   good boy  dex   just one more time  i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me   gwyneth paltrow  as polly perkins  is nothing less than nerve grating  her nasal whining and not quite sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie  perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical    s comic book heroine  who knows  i expected more from her  an example of how a similar character was played  and played well  is in the late    s flick  the phantom   starring kristy swanson and billy zane  rent the movie and you ll know what i mean giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film   angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch  i ll admit it   in just a few short scenes  both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry  two dimensional castmates the plot and steady story progression were old  boring  and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years  the pace is rapid fire in the first half of the movie  and a snail s pace in the second  giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film  but to figure out who the key villain is as well  the pairing is rather clichd  also  polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly ended romance  and their story isn t so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched  when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film  nobody s surprised  and nobody really cares either props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film  and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout  but sky captain  despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie  falls flat on its face  not even worth the       i paid to get into the theater',-1

'sky captain  may be considered an homage to comic books  pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres  one contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences  i don t think this is at all true  one s expectations of the films fiction and serials that  captain  pays tribute to were entirely different  especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children  this film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those  of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama  toward the climax of  captain  law and paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal  they take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with    seconds left to tragedy  of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency one doesn t expect films like this to necessarily  make sense   one does expect them to be fun  thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic   captain  has almost none  remember when law and paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge  well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side  they can fly    the chasm itself means nothing to them  the bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape  if the land across the chasm is  forbidden  to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if i know that paltrow and law  both of whom have given fine performances in the past  were playing  types  but both were pretty flat  only giovanni ribisi  who showed himself capable of great nuance here  and angelina jolie seemed to give any  oomph  to their roles although omid djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he d only been given the chance  he did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted the film had a great  look  but there are so many ways in which cgi distracts  cgi works best when it is used for the fantastical  when it is used to create creatures who don t exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular  when it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints  there is no real sense of wonder  a cgi mountain doesn t have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does  i know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn t necessarily supposed to look real but shouldn t it feel that way  it just didn t as for the weak and clichd script   homage is no excuse  even so  had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable   the last samurai  was as predictable as the days of the week and i am no fan of tom cruise but it had everything that  captain  didn t most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that  sky captain  most definitely did not i d like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the    s and    s  the original  jay garrick  flash or green lantern  alan scott  come to mind as being ripe for such treatment  maybe the better  more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film  it would be hard to be worse',-1

'visually interesting  but falls flat in the originality department  this tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle  jude law has the charisma of burnt toast  but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen on the big screen  in fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film  and had me thinking about work  bills  my dogs  etc  there are many moments that scream bluescreen  paltrow is as wooden as they get  this could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp  my only complaint on the technique is that black   white film  sorry  computer  would of helped because it looks like turner colorized black and white  just a big dull clich mess  i would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again',-1

'sky captain and the world of tomorrow   an amazingly incovenient title  is simply a bad movie  it has no heart  no deep ideas  nothing very special about it  yes  the cgi backgrounds look interesting  but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus  additionally  the movie uses music the same way as  say   gilligan s island  or the scooby doo cartoons   it never stops  terribly  simply terrible  there are no fresh ideas  either  just gobs and gobs and gobs and    etc   of bits taken from older movies and serials  there is no gatekeeper here  the movie just seems to exist because it can  save your money and your time  not entertaining at all',-1

'in a word  this film was boring  it lacked life and spark  a big problem is with the two leads  jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever  he was boring  and she was annoying the visuals were interesting  but they didn t enhance the scenes  if anything  the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen  none of the action sequences felt real  and hence  the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger the film had potential  but it needed a better script  better acting  and a better director  i kept thinking during the film  you know  this movie would ve worked if harrison ford was sky captain  karen allen was polly  and steven spielberg was the director ignore the critical acclaims for this film  the critics i think are praising the film because they  want  to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels',-1

'what a waste of time  i ve tried to sit through  sky captain    about   times  and every time  within about   minutes  i start doing something else   anything else  it s a downright boring movie  the acting is terrible  the writing dull  and obviously a first time director  because it s stiff  and i wanted to love it  i love sci fi  the old cliffhangers  and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon  and metropolis  but my god  what a waste of money  i used to work for paramount pictures  and i had written sherry lansing in      about using blue screen for screen tests  she told me they d never have an interest or need to do it     years later  paramount releases this piece of crap  sherry was right in       but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog  blue screen an effect shot  but not an entire movie  let s not forget  neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors  but easy on the eyes   paltrow s performance reminds me of a high school effort  too bad   it could ve worked  but only under a skilled director  the funny thing is  sky captain s director will keep getting work  even after this dreck  it s commerce  not art',-1

'this movie feels so empty  in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like     because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird the acting was horrible  it s so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives   looking at the floor for their marks   spoilers  also you ll find yourself banging your head watching the movie  at one point at sky captain s home base they have like     planes sitting on the airstrip  they have advanced warning an attack is coming    so what do they do  nothing  all of the planes get blown up and yet again the only person fighting back is the sky captain   the entire world is under attack and he s the only person ever fighting back  at the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally    but what do they do  nothing    the movie is over',-1

'i gave   to this film  i can t understand how ettore scola one of the greater directors of italian cinema  made a film like this  so stupid and ridiculous  all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantial boring and not interesting  too long too boring  the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann  hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film',-1

'for shame  for shame that a fine actor such as joseph fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel  the movie was not only bad  but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality  the plot   was there one   seemed to go no where  the russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances  i gave up about     of the way through and turned it off  a     for awful only because there is nothing lower  don t waste your time on this one  you ll not miss anything',-1

'i have not yet decided whether this will replace anaconda as  the worst film i have ever seen  even if you ignore the dodgy accents  low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it  i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a   hour film the simple answer is   they didn t  characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative  even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it s climax you don t care what happens to any of them i can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from  but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened they even change the true meaning of the books title  rancid aluminium  by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title a real mess of a film from start to finish',-1

'there have been some low moments in my life  when i have been bewildered and depressed  sitting through rancid aluminium was one of these the warning signs were there  no premiere  even the stars didn t want to attend  and no reviews in magazines  the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleep nothing in the film was explained  the narration was idiotic  i cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot  then to my growing despair  it was revealed that he hadn t really been shot dampening my joy  i sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity there were some positive aspects  mainly unintentional moments of humour  for example  the scene in which the main character  for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle  while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears my words cannot explain the anger i feel  so i shall conclude thus rancid aluminium  for sadists  wastrels  and regressives only who want to torture themselves',-1

'well  what to say   having seen the film i still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was   v dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point    i had to look away from the screen  i was feeling physically sick    round and round and round     you get the idea   very very strange accents at many points      those that should know  know unless your getting in for free  or being paid to watch it  or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something   then forget it',-1

'okay  so there aren t really that many great movies around  recent gems like american dream  the straight story and even toy story   don t normally come so close together  but boy     does this film counter balance the quality i have no idea what these people thought they were doing  are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of       i can just see it now   producer    so we ve got joe fiennes  he s cute as a button and was pretty good in shakespeare in love  and we ve got rhys ifans  who isn t cute but was cool in notting hill  we ll mix in a really mediocre score  a few forgettable post britpop tunes  hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you ve got the worst film of the new millennium and believe me  it s gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years  the bank    i like it  any unnecessary sex  bad camera movements  and what about the worst accents this side of devil s own  producer    yeah  we got plenty of those  the bank    sounds great  where do we sign  please',-1

'i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable  the plot was weak to say the least  i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up  i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs    at least i didn t pay to rent it  the best part of the film is definitely dani behr  but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants',-1

'must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time  but this one is up there with the worst of them  plot troubling to follow  sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two  sadly  in my case  i have the dvd  it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time',-1

'i have seen bad films but this took the p     made no sense  and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds  oh and i think one has a low sperm count  its that good  a welshman plays a sweary cockney  a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy  and some lesser lights play dim tarts and there are some russian gangsters  oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs avoid this film like the plague',-1

'the first film i had to walk out on  and it was the cast and crew pre screening  not that i was involved  i hasten to add   i made it through the first hour  so i reckon i m just qualified to comment  but that was my limit like other comments here  how did this get through any kind of qa  an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue  the epitome of wooden acting  awful casting  all wrapped together without a plot tara fitzgerald s casting was bizarre  almost comic  she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history as i left the screening  the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema  they obviously couldn t sit through it again either',-1

'how can you gather this respectable cast of young british actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure  horrible script  annoyingly hectic camera  awfully edited  gruesomely badly acted  only rhys ifans tries to fill his role with life  another painful proof that  different  sometimes equals  dreck   why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand  do yourself a favour  spare yourself and do something else   like hitting a mallet onto your knees  it s less painful and more fun than this movie',-1

'just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film  i decided to write another review  i missed a few things out last time   first  the script  second  the acting  third  jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax   i can t believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or something are you getting the picture',-1

'this is a truly abysmal  lock stock  clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script  i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk  they must have been bribed  a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadn t have paid good money for it i d have turned it off after    minutes  not the worst film ive ever seen  that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie   i use the term loosely   gummo   i feel like suing that so called  director  for the lost hour and a half of my life  but this trash is nearly right down there with it  definitely one of the worst   films i have ever seen  stuff like this reminds hollywood that they don t have a monopoly on truly awful films',-1

'i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad  that has been done in great detail already  many times over  the  plot  started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide boy gangster by numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles  anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves  it is now   or   years since i watched it during its   week run at the cinema before it was pulled  yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seen i am only making these comments  and indeed the only reason i went to see the film  is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second  heavy  in the pub scene  it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifan s face in the bar in  russia   it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island   my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever   he had recently joined an extras  agency and this was his first part  having seen the film  it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever i remember there were about   people in the whole cinema   and this was just a couple of days after it had been released  i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast   and rightly so  in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd  i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red hot  then jam them into your eye sockets  this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film',-1

'there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn t help with the major downsides to the movie  i never understand why directors ask actors actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can t convince  fiennes just can t do irish and fitzgerald isn t much better at russian  when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing  as the for the major problem    the plot    was there one  i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn t wait for the film to end   it was ridiculous  save    minutes of your life and don t watch this movie',-1

'this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today  not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors  so what went wrong  i don t know and simply i don t care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all  be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish  but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot  a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co worker out of his father s company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid  very stupid plot twists devices  i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience  if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather  what about lock  stock     thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film',-1

'words really can t describe how bad this film is  i thought zandalee was bad  but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off  this is just laughable  terrible script  poor direction  awful acting and you know what  i can t think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn t too long  if you want     minutes worth of entertainment  book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work   far more enjoyable and much better value for money  assuming that you need it    incidentally  i need to type    lines of text to complete this review   please do not buy this movie  it is terrible',-1

'i felt rancid aluminium was a complete waste of two hours  the plot line was thin and confusing  the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents  the camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey  it just made it even more difficult to watch  one of the most annoying aspects of rancid aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience  the best performances weren t anything to do with acting  in fact probably the most convincing performance came from dani behr of all people  although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary  do not under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep  there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash',-1

'by far the worst movie of all time  even yaphet kotto could not save this turkey  i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled  the treasure  but was changed to  sharks  treasure  in order to take advantage of the excitement created by  jaws   i think sharks were in one scene of this movie  the fact that they happened to be included in this  thriller  was supposed to sell tickets  didn t work  anytime something  good  happens in the movie  the ship s crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made  gee  do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor  could they have made it any more obvious  the only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing  that s cause enough for celebration',-1

'ok  i have been a huge fan of the black for a long time and was disgusted after seeing this film  let s name the problems   first this film has much of the same crew that the first two had  it has also been called the prequel to the original black stallion  why is it that they can t get shetan s dam s name correct or her color   in the black stallion returns  we learn the sagr was the black s chestnut mother and in this film she is a gray mare name jenny          wtf  and it s set in africa in      and        i could be wrong but the first one was set in the      s as well when the ship wrecks  time line doesn t sound quite right to me  also  as a goof  there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be shetan s father   upon further notice it appears to be a gelding  ben ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way  might be a cute family film to some but it s my biggest movie disappointment of the year',-1

'i understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent i have sat through many movies that don t particularly hold my interest  but i can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children  parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children s activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children s movies  disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name technically  the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over dubbed and unnatural  personally i hate that  but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a    year old for a school project  the  acting  reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices  thankfully it was a very short movie now  before i come off like a video geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick  the one thing that can save even the worst children s movie is a positive message  far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is  let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given if you are lost  don t worry  you will inevitably find your way home approach wild animals without any fear you can win any competition just because you  know  you can and my favorite  the final message left in the film it s okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right',-1

'this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate  it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died  idaho  colorado territories  and montana  it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious  bad man    good man   the script is horrible  there is very little direction  and lousy acting  dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife  mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade  in real life  jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent  he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking  when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city  montana  to insure that he could never terrorize them again  vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately  this is a horrible movie  i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will  even to this day',-1

'overlong drama that isn t capable of making any real point  so she became an actress   so what  she learned to love   big deal  there is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations  but the kind which is bad for the movie  causing it to often seem absurd summer phoenix  playing the lead  talks and behaves like a semi retarded person  so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater   which was clearly not the intended point  we are told early on  in that  barry lyndon  like narration  that she learned to hide her emotions  which certainly explains her autistic stone face  but the movie suffers for it  she basically walks around like a zombie  and her success as an actress isn t quite credible given her lack of emotions  occasionally  the movie had that dull  sleepy feel of a dogma    movie  is it one  i wouldn t be at all surprised summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix  nepotism rarely works if you d like to see my hollywood nepotism list  with over     pictures entries  contact me by e mail',-1

'this movie deserves credit for its original approach  it combines elements of theater  film  and epic storytelling  unfortunately  it falls flat on all levels  the films biggest weakness is it s unwillingness to commit to anything  it has camp  moralistic  and epic elements without ever committing to any of them  as for the story itself  chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable  unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl most likely two types of people will see this  francophiles or arthuriophiles  speaking as one of the latter  i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby  disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story',-1

'this movie is probably the worst i have seen  bad acting  bad script  bad everything  comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting  both cyborg  van damme        and nemesis  olivier gruner        are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it s albert pyun who has directed these two as well the story is not original  the world has become a terrible place  possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war  and people live under medieval circumstances  a special breed of robots  cyborgs  live on human blood and there s the story    the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there  prophecy  and the humans need someone to stop them  one girl together with a robot  kris kristofferson  built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind in this movie the director tries some hong kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far  the movie fails miserably in this attempt i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new  worst ever  movie to relate to  and to fans of the genre i recommend  cyborg  since i think it s a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor  and if you can t stand van damme then check out  nemesis  i rated this movie',-1

'knights was just a beginning of a series  a pilot  one might say  the plot  i really shouldn t call it that  there wasn t any plot  wasn t logical at all and there were many mistakes  like  warning  i m summarizing the plot  in the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs  the bad guys  but after the climax  nea found out that there were many many more left of them  and it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill  but after a month s training  nea could kill them with a single blow the movie was just pure kicking  i wasn t surprised at all  when i found out that the leading star was a kick boxer there was one positive thing in the whole movie  it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends  i recommend watching it  if you are in need of laughter',-1

'there are two groups of people   those who love every fellini movie they see and normal people  while i will admit that i have really enjoyed some of his films  i can also honestly say that i can t stand some of them  my opinion  by the way  is not just some knee jerk reaction  i have seen most of fellini s films and have also seen many films by the world s most famous directors  with this in mind  i feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both godard and fellini  they both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the  intelligensia   while the average person would never sit through some of their films  heck  even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films  so  since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses  it s not surprising that their films are so often praised  it s like a cult  if you don t believe me  think about many of godard s films such as first name carmen or alphaville    or what about fellini satyricon or juliet of the spirits  these films abound with boredom  weirdness and incomprehensibility  now i am not saying a film can t be weird  after all i love happiness of the katakuris and shaolin soccer   but it must be watchable now on to this movie  somehow  fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy  this is no small task  it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable  instead of cheap sexual thrills  the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that donald sutherland looks like a ghoul  i know some of this must have been fellini s intention  but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance  especially since sutherland s lines are all poorly dubbed into italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself  unfortunately  when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades  there really isn t anything else to watch an interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of fellini s wife  giulietta masina  considering that in addition to this  that in previous decades fellini had masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman  it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen  i read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well  this is about the only aspect of this turgid film that i found at all interesting  don t say i didn t warn you',-1

'i should explain why i gave this    piece of art    star rating out of possible     simply because it s hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased  probably it would have been the same if i had given it         explanations anyway would have followed i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so   i think that s disgusting and pretty terrible  in all the possible contextual meanings   but as i found out after watching this movie   there is a genre called  historical drama    and probably it would have been the case of       as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it  and made kill bill   to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible   but the thing about  historical drama  genre is that it s a sub category of the  trash movies  where john romero is the undead gory emperor of the guts and so automatically it can t be rated as your default movie   as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you can t really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so  or it was simply bad  it s for the people who like to enjoy bad acting  bad screenplay and bad everything else  and by some turn of faith   i am one of them too  there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go   the day is saved  but that s definitely an opinion of mine and doesn t have match with anyones  else what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie   then fellini s casanova is definitely the choice  but heed my advice and don t rate it by default means',-1

'as a dane i m proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years  it s a terrible shame  however  that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism  in fact  it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies  and as a result i have stopped watching them in theaters i know it s wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie  so let me stress that  villa paranoia  would be a terrible film under any circumstances  the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film  furthermore  waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings  i particularly enjoyed  de frigjorte          as an actor he is usually funny  though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies  namely that of a working class slob who s down on his luck  partly because he s a slob but mostly because of society  and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community this is problem number one in  villa paranoia   clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer  which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible it is much worse  however  that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on  for instance  the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near death experience of the main character with the use of low budget effects and bad camera work  after that  the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge  this is symptomatic of the whole movie  there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters  and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is  telling instead of showing  thus  at one point  you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels  because the script wouldn t allow him to act out his feelings  and later on  voice over is abruptly introduced  quite possibly as an afterthought  to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director s ineptitude  fortunately  at this point you re roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters  let alone the so called story the acting  which has frequently been a problem in clausen s movies  can be summed up in one sad statement  sren westerberg bentsen  whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother  is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast i give this a   out of    rating',-1

'i have been using imdb for years and i never wanted to get involved in the commentary of moviesuntil now  this documentary has so many problems that i hardly know what to say  i am not a muslim  nor am i an islamic studies expert  but i know enough to shed some light on the obvious one sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses the problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary  most of the documentaries that i have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation  this is certainly the case with islam  what the west needs to know  yes  there are fundamentalists around the world  and some of them are muslim  but to build a documentary about all of islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading  this is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of islam and nothing more for those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary  here are several points that may help there was nothing positive about islam presented in the documentary the documentary focuses on the middle east  but more muslims live outside of that region  more muslims live in china  believe it or not  than in saudi arabia  about     of all muslims live in pakistan  bangladesh  india and indonesia the translation of the qur an used in the documentary is a questionable one  i watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking  i had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now i know why  surrah      is a good example  the documentary suggests that the surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell  but the translation i have reads instead   those who reject truth among the people of the book and among the polytheists will be in hellfire   the difference is that those who reject truth are those people who know about god and the truth of god and decide to reject it anyways the movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in islam  but this is not true  although it is true that much comes from the qur an and hadith  islam also recognizes a concept called  urf or  normative behavior   obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways  but  urf is meant to be  good  behavior  what an average person would consider right or wrong the documentary presents shar ia  islamic law  as being one unified body of knowledge that all muslims follow  this is simply not true  there are many islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law the hadith tradition is similar  there are thousands of hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others  using the hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate  real and applicable  is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say which is what the documentary did what i hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem  not islam or any other religion  christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on  i know this is not the same as suicide bombing  just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem  if you feel you have the answer  then everyone else must be wrong  but if you feel you have an answer you can work together with other people s views about politics  religion  god  or whatever',-1

'it is not obvious from viewing this film  so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it  but this presentation on the realities of islam  and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non muslims is lacking objectiveness  and also completely fails to factor in the human condition  it is one thing to document that the koran says many things about how a devout muslim is required to interact with non muslims  but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of islam  will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system  there is reason to call much about the presenters into question  such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism  don t swallow it all  hook  line  and sinker  without some thinking of your own one specific  for instance  is researching the person walid shoebat  who claims to be a former muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in bethlehem  there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions  i am not nor have i ever been a muslim  i have never read the koran  i am not a christian  nor a member of  any  faith  but i am an intelligent and discerning human  while the film is quite disturbing  in its presentation of how some muslims view their obligation to islam  i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the fundamentalists  just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical christians  so  too  there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among jews and muslims when you watch this film  you need to have the salt shaker on hand  one grain will not be enough  you ll need more  please use your own mind and think for yourself  research what is presented  and evaluate the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in    minutes of video  there is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together  indicating a definite bias  be your own brain',-1

'before i start  let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing  which i gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some  so  it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new dvd version would make a difference  i have also not read the corresponding book  i m only familiar with one other japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context potential minor spoilers ahead i usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories  the likes of blade runner     monkeys  etc    but i did not enjoy this movie at all  while it started out mildly intriguing  it became tedious by the time it was only half way finished  there are all sorts of problems  let s start with what is probably the most severe  the dialogue  the characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences  if they aren t shouting each other s names for the n th time  they are usually grunting monosyllables   kanedaaa     tetsuoooo     huh     grrr   etc    this leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two dimensional  it doesn t help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals the grunting is augmented by some random pseudo philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by star trek standards  there is nothing deep and meaningful here   it all seems haphazard  thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever what little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction  not that there s anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction  of course  but in this case you ll find yourself asking  what s the point of it all  and how long until it s over   character development in the last    minutes or so consists of little more than tetsuo turning into pizza the hutt for no readily apparent reason the ending resembles the one in        a bizarre string of images that  far from resolving or explaining anything  leave the viewer feeling he s just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours  i m sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art  but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes   some of the music was also quite interesting   unfortunately it s all style and no substance tired of disney  want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with  adult  themes  i m sad to say you re more likely to find that sort of thing in  south park',-1

'when i first started watching this movie i was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train  the interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring  its not that i don t get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact  it s just that in this film they are very boring  if you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you d be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you  it is realistic but you wouldn t go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie',-1

'this film is so bad  you can t imagine  the acting is terrible  even worse than in third class soap operas  an it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past    years in switzerland  the interactions between the soldiers didn t make any sense at all  the story could have been taken out from a bravo photo story  the dialogues were as wooden as treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy  but nowadays it doesn t need much to satisfy the audience  the actors were handsome for example the former miss switzerland and the main character was even hung  woah    and there certainly was much abuse of drugs  that s real cool man  particularly for    and    year old teens  but the media created an atmosphere in witch you was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the peer group dynamics by telling implicitly that you are a nerd if you don t go along with the other  sheep  and say yes that is exactly what it was like when i was in the army  that s exactly what i m going to do when i must go to the army   to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and coolness  and don t think i like the army  i was there and i hated it but this film is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a teeth brush  which i was forced to do because i offended an lieutenant  it is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated  sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and i think its not a bad thing  but this kind of films influence teenagers to much by showing them a cool lifestyle which in fact is only stupid and turns them into brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots  but since i now that my opinion isn t very popular i will be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any costs and for that to save your wits      sorry for my bad english',-1

'i ll probably get a lot of flack for hating this movie  guess i didn t approach it with the proper dewy eyed nostalgia of the generation before me  but suffice it to say  st elmo s fire was pretty crap freaking  tastic  even as far as brat pack films go here is yet another lovely example of the smug  self indulgent neurosis that is everything   s  rent  anyone   the plot is virtually non  existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best  poorly delivered the rest of the time  the complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesn t help the situation  there really was no growth  no forward movement at all  even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest  most predictable way possible  the stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a stalker and andie macdowell is gorgeous  the jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is  well  a jackass  the gorgeous slut hides really soulful  deep pain with a wild lifestyle  the poet moods and mopes around for a full     of the film until he can reveal     he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows  the virgin finally becomes a whole  happy human being after getting every virgin s desire of one hot roll in the sack with a jackass before he ditches her to really change  for real this time   the cheating bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught  and finally the feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters  commitment  which brings me to my final beef  what bond of super cement was holding these people together as friends  i can t imagine being with just one of them  now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar  and they were all so terrible to each other  heads in toilets  near rape  and sleeping around with everrrryone  the cherry was after two bffs act like total baboons after screwing the feminist  she s like   umm  actually i don t want to be with either of you anymore  let s be friends  and we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that i may hook up with one or the other at any given point  but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment  not that word     and they all smile as if to say   golly gee  i never thought of that  what a great idea  only it s not  kinda in the way that watching this movie is not',-1

'i saw this in the theater when it came out  and just yesterday i saw it again on cable  this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is  the whole bunch of characters are self absorbed narcisstic preeners  worst of all  it reinforces every negative stereotype about    something dating  even as it purports to celebrate people  finding themselves   the nice guys finish last  the jerky guys make out great  the jerkiest guys do best  the girls are all boy toy pushovers  only one character   wendy   is seen doing anything remotely useful to society  and she dispenses with her long saved virginity in a throwaway one night stand with a scumbag  in a lushly filmed scene that we re supposed to think is romantic  what this really is is hollywood s concept of young america  permissive  detached  promiscuous  conceited',-1

'what happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is  just one year after  the breakfast club   a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in  st  elmo s fire   who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles was it the directing or the writing  since it was the same person  joel schumacher  it must be both  but then schumacher has since given us  the phantom of the opera    phone booth    a time to kill   and two batman movies   batman and robin  and  batman forever  which range from good to great directing  something went wrong on  stef  because it has no genius whatsoever  no comedy worth anything  and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life example  the character wendy  a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by mare winningham   reveals to billy  an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends  drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by rob lowe  that she is still a virgin  billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but wendy  is not ready   wendy  in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends  later in the story  when billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together  billy is leaving for new york  deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter  he convinces wendy that her virginity would be the perfect  going away gift  from her to him  and wendy  who works as a social worker helping broken families  seems not to be phased at all by this despot  give me a break  the one thing she can only give once  she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends  schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue i suppose some may say that  that was the    s  but i remember it was in the     s  that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out i think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right as for the technique  not the story   it was terrible as well  it is disjointed and feels like a   hour movie that has been edited to   hour and    minutes  transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense  pick up what is on the editing room floor  put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better   but it still is a horrible movie maybe schumacher has become a better and stronger director since       he must have  or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for st elmo s fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way   that is what i really think happened',-1

'i noticed  fire  was on cable the other night and i began watching it because i couldn t recall anything specific about it other than i remember it being a horrible film when i saw it back in      twenty years later the film is still awful  besides the synthesizer  the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the     s  as is evident in the title song  hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them  and to compound this musical assault rob lowe s character played saxophone  and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was charlie parker  only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo  all the characters were intensely unappealing  although i must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them  actually i thought mare winningham was appealing  and i initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear  but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with rob lowe s character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon',-1

'i don t know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it  perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about  perhaps it was the disorganized storyline  perhaps it was the fact that rob lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner  perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song  perhaps it was because the     s were never that   s  perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole  perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out  i don t know what it was that made me hate it so  but if it means trying to watch it again i m not willing to find out',-1

'heather graham couldn t play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it  who do the producers of the movie think they are  the absolute worst  most unrealistic movie i ve seen in as long as i can remember  this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign up on imdb and make sure the rating of this  film  drops omg i m heather graham  i just kissed a drunk chick  so while she s passed out i m really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically  what have i done      jesus heather  get over it and grow up    and i d like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers    and while i m at it  instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story  perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who s mentally unstable    like your so called  lesbian  character    after all  i know the first time i had gay sex  when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street    honestly b tch  get a grip   what a joke  and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick  but i m so sick of even thinking about it anymore  bottom line  if you re a smart person you ll hate this movie  and if you re not a smart person  then you ll love it    it s as simple as that',-1

'i don t know who sue kramer  the director of this film is  but i have a strong suspicion that a  she is a lesbian and b  she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic i can imagine everyone thinking   my god  this is horrible  not funny  pedestrian  totally lame   but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti gay or they  don t get  the gay lifestyle   this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too   anyway  it s not even worth reviewing  the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do  it s full of clichs and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing   much less funny i hated it and i m not afraid to say so  too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb weren t as unbiased in their judgment',-1

'oh my god   the worst sh t i ve ever seen  this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie  and i really do not understand anybody with opposite myth  though  maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable  i especially mean the role of h  graham  what was that    in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers  the character was played in affected and annoying way  every time she appears it reminds that you  re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment  then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion  terrible  don t waste your time',-1

'wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen   this person should never make another movie  i cant believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience you have have wasted every cent  no concept of real life  i have wasted   hours of my life i will never get back  ever    everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed       i m embarrassed for them  all of you should be ashamed  if i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by   years  please never watch this movie i have never written a blogg about a film before but the distaste for this film has compelled me to do so',-1

'it is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any  gray matters  will agree that this movie just doesn t work the problems lay in the direction  cast selections and lack of depth in the character building  the word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used  let s look at the problems in direction script brother and sister both in their mid    s seem to be well adjusted  they meet a complete stranger at a park and heather graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer  he then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him  then after one date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in vegas in a week s time     hello does anyone feel stupid yet  he goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about    words that we see on the screen and he wants to marry her  not only was there no chemistry it just doesn t make sense  sure it s a romantic comedy and i want to believe it could  but the direction made it completely flat now heather falls head over heels with her too and when heather graham and bridget moynahan  very shallow character  kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry might be there  i found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say heather cannot act i think the reality is heather was clearly the wrong person for this role this was sue kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew  it would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and imho it could be done with better writers and casting and direction',-1

'i watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed heather graham and tom cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours  or however long it actually was   from the beginning  every single element of this movie is unbelievable  this movie made me chuckle several times  but they were mainly out of shock that the director writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together the movie s focus is gray  graham  and her issues with intimacy  things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly way too much in common interesting  intriguing  however  instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable  the director keeps taking gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all  being an lgbt individual  this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming out process   i ll be insulted if the writer s queer   had it not been for the cute chemistry between cavanaugh and graham  which  by the way  was understandably forced   i would give it a negative   stars',-1

'i had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end    having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom  what really horrifies me  i mean truly disturbs me  is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as  delightful  or a  must see   i would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants the truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten  it is decidedly unfunny  poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold  canned rice pudding  to be kind to ms kramer  the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity  for having read the synopsis before i watched it  i had expected something more challenging  the possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co dependence  the unexpected awakening of  sisterly  sexuality  and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry  for the affections of the same girl  were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration  yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from instead  the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations  with clichd characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction  the lack of directorial control seems astounding  on the one hand  moynahan  cavanagh and spacek all give very pedestrian performances  while heather graham and molly shannon   the latter in particular   veer towards embarrassing over compensation at times  one could lay the blame for this on the director   maybe sue kramer hopes that if her actors over act  they will force a bigger laugh from the audience  but then again  the cast is a veteran one  one would expect them to do better sue kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make  and for whom  given the possible issues gray matters alludes to  and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy  perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead  i know it is never easy to make films about women and women s issues  especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone  but whatever direction she takes  inconsequential and flimsy characters like gray are not going to cut mustard',-1

'i enjoyed the night listener very much  it s one of the better movies of the summer robin williams gives one of his best performances  in fact  the entire cast was very good  all played just the right notes for their characters   not too much and not too little  sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch  toni collette is great as the mom  and never goes over the top  everyone is very believable it s a short movie  just under an hour and a half  i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version  i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion  which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads  it is not a hitchcockian thriller  see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well  if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed my only complaint with the movie was the ending  the director could have left a little more to the audience s imagination  but this is a minor quibble',1

'the night listener is probably not one of william s best roles  but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie  i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before  some people maybe won t like the slow pacing of this movie  but i think it s the great plus of the movie  it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year       it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content  dramatic feeling  this is no americanized movie  neither is it a predictable movie  you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be  this is no excellent movie that has everything  but hell  it s a damn good and very original movie',1

'the night listener held my attention  with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a    year old boy  rory culkin  who is very ill  williams has never met the boy in person  as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone  however  williams  ex boyfriend  nice job from bobby cannavale  raises doubt about the boy  which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person  what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect  i will leave it at that  toni collette also stars i enjoyed this film  with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin s adoptive mother  sandra oh also starred as williams  friend  the night listener is inspired by actual events  and it has a somber  almost creepy silence throughout  at times it is predictable  no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic  but i liked it anyway  i enjoy williams in roles like this  more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me  recommended',1

'popular radio storyteller gabriel no one robin williams scraggy and speaking in hushed hypnotic tones  becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen year old boy from wisconsin named pete logand rory culkin  who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents  to boot pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still since his partner jess bobby cannavale good happens to be a survivor of hiv himself he also acquaints himself with pete s guardian a woman named donna toni collette brilliant  and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin he discovers some secrets he was naturally not prepared to find based on real events that happened to armistead maupin who co wrote the screenplay with terry anderson and directed by patrick stetner this film moves a lot faster    min  maybe a few minutes longer than one might think a movie of this genre would run  that s good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear  it s bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn t sew up any of the plot openings or back story  i d rather not go into any great detail except to say that if you are not familiar with mr maupin s works or his personal story you feel a little bit out of the loop here  still the performances by williams  i would ve loved to heard more of his narration personally  collette cannavale culkin and much of the supporting cast the waitress at the restaurant collete s donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has  are top notch and the mood established here  namely the chilly lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york  give a terrific framing for this story  it may have ends that don t tie together particularly well but it s still a compelling enough story to stick with',1

'if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing  the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery  and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about  however  there is not much tension  and williams  mild mannered portrayal doesn t do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear  the production felt rushed and holes are apparent  it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort  the book is probably better one thing is certain  taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort',1

'this night listener is better than people are generally saying  it has weaknesses  and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis  no doubt  but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this  the whole thing feels like one of those fireside  this happened to a friend of a friend of mine  ghost stories  one big complaint about the movie is the pacing  but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate  everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility  and real life just sort of plods alongno  so there are no flashy endings or earth shattering revelations  no  showdown  scenes  thank heaven  you have to get into the zone when watching this movie  forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a  conventionally good movie  williams isn t terrific  but he easily meets the needs of the story  plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic   no one   as he is the everyman  the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story  toni collette s performance should be nominated for an oscar  even if she maybe shouldn t win it   give it a shot  for quality and content alone  the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days',1

'after seeing several movies of villaronga  i had a pretty clear opinion about him    he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters  forgetting about a rhythm of the movie  that is why  though having good critics  his movies never caught the broad audience attention  in aro he follows the same line  but really improved on the rhythm  especially in the end of the movie  frankly speaking  i slept through the first part  cause though the first part gives necessary information  it is really slow  nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga recommended',1

'there s so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin  en la mente del asesino  inside the killer s mind   that it s very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning  let s just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really  really great done  its made with super    black and white shots     milimeters  color  interviews  flashbacks  aro tolbukhin its like a movie made a documental or viceversa  which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering  did he really ever existed  the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala  worked in a religious mission and then killed some people  an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced  the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death  nowadays  some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character  the one we are witness of  the movie for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aros mind  mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done  nevertheless  the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view  they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions  we clearly never justify them  so  the first half is based upon recollecting information  later things turn into aro s childhood  giving the movie such an incredible new force  even tough never got weak or boring  i don t mean  and don t want  to spoil anything  so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you  believe me  the trip to see it is more than worthy',1

'what s inexplicable  firstly  the hatred towards this movie  it may not be the greatest movie of all time  but gimme a break  it got    oscars for a reason  it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason  it s a damn good movie  which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it  i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters  i ve rewatched it on tv and video  and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen  twice  or maybe three times  actually   but that might be it  the appeal of it  it s a movie  yes  capital m there  it s an epic  it s a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur  now  ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me  with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama  not that titanic has none of that  well  the acting was actually very good  the melodrama was quite heavy handed at times but the reason titanic works is that it s such an emotional ride  i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind  or give me a visual thrill  this movie isn t exactly dumb  but it s not cerebral at all  the visual thrills are simply means to an end  to fuel the emotions of the audience  i didn t cry when bambi s mom died  i don t react to tearjerkers  but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million  an emotional rollercoaster that  if it were a regular one  would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl  and i m sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it  and have a ready supply of cynicism  then you can thoroughly dislike this movie  but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit  if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt  you ll enjoy it completely  and look at the top ten grossing films of all time  is a single one of them bad  is a single one of them worth a score of   out of     no  not even the phantom menace  and this movie made     billion dollars worldwide  it can t be bad  not possible        p s  how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman  spiderman was a fun movie  but it was a total      kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did  it simply wasn t anything all that special  no one will remember it in    years  but i m pretty sure titanic will be remembered',1

'previously  i wrote that i loved  titanic   cried at its ending  many times over   and i m a guy in his    s  i also wondered about why this great movie  which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics  was given only a     rating by imdb com users well  i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings  while       of all votes gave it a    rating        gave it a   rating  these       of these irrational imdb users  in effect  pulled the overall rating down to     in my previous comments  i blamed this very unusual voting pattern  a sudden surge in   ratings  with a high    rating  dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the   rating level  on only one thing  hatred for leonardo dicaprio  believe me  i ve tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people  young men  mostly   who defame him left and right  they absolutely hate the man  and they will have no part in giving him any credit in  titanic    to answer one other user  i am not talking about someone who just really doesn t like the movie that much  and gave it a   or a    etc  everyone has  and is entitled to  his her own taste  but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only     overall for  titanic   pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous   ratings  is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture  let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of  titanic  to   randomly chosen box office and critical  bombs   there are many more  but these   will prove my point    heaven s gate         was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing  and imdb voters  ratings were           ratings and        ratings  overall rating of        big top pee wee         got         ratings and        ratings  overall rating of        cat people         got         ratings and        ratings  overall rating of        blind date         got         ratings and        ratings  overall rating of        jumpin  jack flash         got         ratings and        ratings  overall rating of       what do all of these films have in common with  titanic   all of the percentages of their   ratings are lower      than  titanic   and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award  again   titanic  got         ratings  compare that to the other   movies i just mentioned can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor',1

'the movie titanic makes it much more then just a  night to remember   it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten  why so criticised  i have no idea  could will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it  could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece  it will be almost impossible the director no doubt had the major impact on the film  a simple disaster film  boring to watch  converted to an unbelievable romance  yes i m not the romance type either  but that should not bother you  because you will never see a romance like this  guaranteed  everything to the amazing effects  to the music  to the sublime acting the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling  everything looks very real and live  the legend herself  titanic  is shown brilliantly in all classes  too looks  too accommodation  the acting was the real effect  dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles  no one could have done better  they are partly the reason why the film is so great i guess it s not too much to talk about  the plot is simple  the acting is brilliant  based on a true story  probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears  thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten  well if you haven t seen this film your missing out on something hesterical  and a film to idolise for hollywood  could it get better  no  not at all  the most moving film of all time  don t listen to people  see for yourself then you will understand  a landmark   don t be surprised if you cry too',1

'i had few problems with this film  and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated  true  it is over three hours long  but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly  i don t think it is overrated at all  i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent  the film looks sumptuous  with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects  and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus  leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack  and kate winslet is lovely as rose  david warner  a great actor  steals every scene he s in  the story is very rich in detail  and is hot on character development  obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be  though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow  the last hour is extremely riveting  and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat  when the titanic sank  i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving  the music score by james horner was lovely  though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on  the      miniseries was good  but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies  overall  i give titanic an         bethany cox',1

'i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies  anyway  everyone remembers the rms titanic  it was big  fast  and  unsinkable     until april       it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever  well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship  well  onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film so our two main characters are jack  leonardo dicaprio  and rose  kate winslet   they re not annoying too much but watch this and you ll find out why they could become annoying   http   tinyurl com ojhoyn    the main villain i guess is bad luck  fate  hand of god  no blasphemy intended   or just plain caledon hockley  billy zane   combine all of the above and what do you get   oh yes  we get a love story on a sinking boat  the supporting characters are the following  my personal favorite  mr  andrews  victor garber  idk he was so nice   lovejoy david warner   murdoch ewan stewart   lightoller  jonathan phillips   captain smith bernard hill   molly brown kathy bates   and many more  we also got the present day treasure hunter  brock lovett  bill paxton   they add something to the story  something good  the action in here is awesome  especially in the second half  the drama as also good  in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears  the story is simple and it works  a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond  she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic  two lovers separated by social class and ultimately  the fate of the ship  everything about the story works and there are very few flaws  i give titanic  an     awesome',1

'titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill fated voyage on the unsinkable ship  writer director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april          claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic  the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet  they make for a good on screen couple  dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable  they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well  the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane  kathy bates  frances fisher  jonathan hyde  and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film  the love story  the action  suspense  and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time  the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation  the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it s few flaws  titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it  the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg  overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch',1

'the ship may have sunk but the movie didn t    director  james cameron  from  the terminator  did it again with this amazing picture  one of my favorite scenes is  the dinner table  scene  in which rose s family and friends meet jack after he saves her  rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet  the one    i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband jack and rose have a connection that is  movie stuff  but it s good movie stuff  we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth  rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her  i really liked the hanging over the boat scene  it was a good risk the movie is long but it s fantastic    good story  good flow  good actors    go see it twice if you want  its worth it',1

'titanic has to be one of my all time favorite movies  it has its problems  what movies don t  but still  it s enjoyable when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic  i suppose my first reaction is  wait a minute  you don t   i know so many people who don t like this movie  and i m not saying i don t see why   the love story is too cheesy  well  yes but isn t it enjoyable and moving  all right  the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic  everyone knows that love like this doesn t actually exist  but this is a movie  doesn t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while  the next complaint  dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors  well  ok  in this movie  i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials  however i think it s unfair to say that they are terrible actors  i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in  but the roles they are given are simple  and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit  but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected and finally  if one is going to complain that they don t like this movie because they hate romance  or because they hate history  or tragic movies  then i m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things  it s like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies  simply for being a movie  not because you dislike the genre  this is a good movie well deserving of its oscars  in particular  best cinematography  which i find to be the best i ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy i know some of the writing fails  such as the constant screaming of each other s names throughout the movie  the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times  but overall it s an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real  and the sinking feel so epic i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie  but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea  such as it being a love story  rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic  including memoirs form the day it happened  and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults  the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper  not steel  and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it i give this movie        not because i like romance movies  but simply because it s an outstanding cinematic achievement  that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events',1

'titanic is a classic  i was really surprised that this movie didn t have a solid ten  overall in the imdb user rankings  maybe  it s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays  but when it was first made it was really something  when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters  when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month  it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason  some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot  like the frozen baby  or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd  many people died on that ship  and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to  and let s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose  whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone s imagination it was lovely  they barely knew each other  but they would die for each other  they trusted each other  they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money   i ll never let go  jack   titanic is a great film down to it s very core  it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting  excellent cinematography  beautiful music  and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers  it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie',1

'another aussie masterpiece  this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural  and it does very well  it doesn t resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks  it focuses more on emotional impact  a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney   co  bring to life  it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside  and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago  strange things begin to happen in the house  and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared  who was actually a mass murderer  highly recommended',1

'for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time  no exceptions  james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller  through films such as aliens  the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science fiction goes  he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film  but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance  the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises  plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows  the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful  interesting and entertaining film about it  the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren t given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose  gloria stuart  tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose s and jack s story alone  no one else  emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home  the music has become iconic and legendary  it is composer james horner s finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience  the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is  only one problem  the usual james cameron problem  is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside  james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime  my heart won t go on from this one',1

'back in       do i remember that year  clinton bans cloning research  the unfortunate death of princess diana  the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets  this was also the big year in the release of titanic  one of the biggest films of all time  a tale about the ship of dreams  about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster  i don t think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was  the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans      of them being teenage girls  i was    years old at the time  and of course saw the movie multiple times  it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful  at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong  of course i grew up and didn t watch the film since i was     a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for      and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now  was it worth the hype  was it really the best movie of all time  was that leonardo s real nose  ok  i know that s silly to say  but i did re watch the film  being completely honest here  titanic is a great movie  best movie of all time  no  just depends on your idea of a good movie  but titanic delivered in romance  humor  disaster  emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic  searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean  unsuccessful  they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude  wearing the heart of the ocean  dated the day the titanic sank      year old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing  and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing  she and her granddaughter elizabeth  lizzy  calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship  when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace  rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic  revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater  in       the upper class    year old rose boards the ship with her fianc  cal hockley and her mother  ruth dewitt bukater  both of whom stress the importance of rose s engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt bukater debts  while they have the outward appearance of the upper class  rose and her mother are financially broke  distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage  rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern  before she leaps  a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes  jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life  and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching  their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first class formal dinner of the rapport building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance  music and beer in third class  but after cal s servant informs him of rose s whereabouts   rose is forbidden from seeing jack again  however  after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven year old daughter to behave like a  proper lady  at tea  rose defies him and her mother  asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean  an engagement present from cal  after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time  they go to the deck of the ship they then witness the ship s fatal collision with an iceberg  after overhearing the ship s lookouts discussing how serious the collision is  rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal  meanwhile  cal discovers rose s nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe  so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack s pocket  upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck  rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him  jack and rose return to the top deck  cal and jack  though enemies  both want rose safe  so they persuade her to board a lifeboat  but after realizing that she cannot leave jack  rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship s first class staircase  jack and rose return to the top deck  the lifeboats have gone  and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down so does titanic live up to it s hype  i still say that this is a great movie to watch  i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie  but it has great acting  amazing effects  a well written story and still looks flawless  love it or hate it  you have to admit this movie didn t get a lot of hype just because of leo s baby face or kate s amazing ability to cry on sight  this film is something special  it will always hold a special place in my heart  it has too seeing that i saw this film   times in the theater when it was released  but all that aside  i do recommend this movie  it s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day',1

'titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic  the plot is simple  noncomplicated  or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense  the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film  but the love story is an interesting one  however  kate winslett is wonderful as rose  an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal  billy zane   early on the voyage rose meets jack  leonardo dicaprio   a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game  if he wants something  he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries  the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures  that sunk with the titanic  which has recently occurred  one of the survivors of the titanic  rose dewitt bukater  who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search  she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic  with this  the scene shifts to southhampton  ireland where the titanic set sail from on april          as all the passengers are boarding  after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york  historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful  but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger  jack dawson  captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned  smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the titanic s legs out to full speed  the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs  but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie  on april          at        an iceberg was sighted  they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film  the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate  the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until      when the lights finally failed  the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic s many pleas for help  the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own  the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship  overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too  the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking  also  the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold  which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle  overall  the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship  the core group of rose  jack  cal  and rose s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time  yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown  captain edward smith  the ship designer  thomas andrew  the white star line representative  bruce ismay  and all of the titanic s officers were real  the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards  he had been a part of the white star line since      where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire s captain when the titanic sunk  the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol  he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer s former canadian hometown  as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower class passengers from non english speaking nations  in addition  officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted  the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss   not wanting to leave her husband s side mrs  strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic  furthermore  mr  goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best  the richest man on the ship  john jacob astor  who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well  but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat  in addition  molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water  her ticket on the titanic had cost over four thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke  all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware  the gymnasium  which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs  the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re creation of the post victorian era of       the rich at this time practically ruled everything  as the women s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet  women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do  the rich did not take well to  new money  such as molly brown as depicted  everything of the time was very formal  women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes  smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes  which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie  men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes  women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society  although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken  the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise  the director  james cameron  shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people s lives  everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night  in addition  this film is a reflection of the      s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic  only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored  this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed  however  the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed  there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed  as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter technically the film is very well done  to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie  in addition  a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean  cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the    years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship  furthermore  throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage  this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner  at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art  a true epic  like most history novels  we know the ending  but it doesn t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture  certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming  sound  cintematography  and editing  if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early      s and how they face disaster  then this movie definitely is for you',1

'i find it so amazing that even after all these years  we are still talking about this movie  obviously this movie wasn t that bad or else people wouldn t even bother to talk about it  i personally enjoyed this film immensly  and still do  i guess this film isn t for everyone  but it certainly did touch the hearts of many as for those that think that this film is  overrated  or  over hyped    well  we only have the movie going public to thank for that  lol  you see  it s not critics article writers that make a film  huge  or a  hit  with the general movie going public  people make the film a huge success  with titanic  everyone was in awe  let s face it  a film like this had never been made before  at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking  this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april       even the silverware for goodness sakes matched give this movie a break you guys  the critics thought this movie would sink big time  when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth  which is the best form of advertisement mind you  that this was a good decent movie worth seeing  then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie   not once  not twice  but maybe   times and more  so  i really wouldn t say that this movie was  overhyped    at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being  overhyped   ha  critics didn t even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron s gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film  however  the films money took care of that     million budget and much more personally  i love this film  however  this film might not be for everyone  don t say that this film sucks just because of romance though  that is the most sexist thing i ve ever heard  disliking a movie just because it has romance in it  the story was sweet  the dialogue could have been better  but let s face it   the real star of the movie wasn t leo or kate   it was that gigantic ship  i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job  it s not thier best work  i ve seen much better work from both of them  but it wasn t the worst i ve seen on screen before  give them a break',1

'i avoided watching this film for the longest time  long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over hyped  over blown  overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz  and i wanted nothing to do with it  i never watched it in the theatre  i shook my head in disbelief at the    academy awards   even though i had never seen it  then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest  one of the girls spoke about this movie   it was so great   she said   you really felt like you were on the ship    nonsense   i thought  i shared my feelings with my fellow judges  one looked at me and said   you might be right  but if she liked the movie that much maybe she ll want to learn more about the real titanic  the movie must have done something right to get her so interested    well  maybe   thought i  then it finally appeared on pay tv   ok   i thought   i ll give it a look see   i didn t want to like it   and i didn t  i loved it  what a great movie where to start  first   the directing  my high school public speaking contestant was right  james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost  you are there  type of atmosphere  the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world  the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads  then the rising sense of panic  you don t just watch it  you really do feel it  then   the performances  the lead performances from kate winslet  as rose  and leonardo dicaprio  as jack  are excellent   winslet s being the superior  i thought  but both were good  they had their rich girl poor boy characters down to a perfect  t  i thought  in my opinion  though  stealing the show was frances fisher as rose s mother  she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat  and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack  then   the details  i m no expert on the sinking of the titanic  but i have a reasonable general knowledge  and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance  very impressive  indeed  then   the song  who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dion s performance of  my heart goes on  problems  well  the romance was perhaps too contrived  in the sense that i just don t accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class   i know he was invited the first time  but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he s been there for a while   the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed  i thought  when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats a minor quibble  though  this is truly an excellent movie  my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre  where i think it would have been so much more impressive',1

'to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue  the budget  the this and the that    who wants to hear it  if you missed the point of this beyond beautiful movie  that s your loss  the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think  i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life  and this one stands in its own entity  in my book  it was not supposed to be a documentary  or a completely factual account of what happened that night  it is the most amazing love story ever attempted  i know that it is the cynical    s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy  but come on  someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money  how lame is that  it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet  and is the top grossing film in the planet  i will gladly side with the majority this time around  okay  cynics  time to crawl back under your rock  i am done',1

'every once in a while the conversation will turn to  favorite movies   i ll mention titanic  and at least a couple people will snicker  i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago  these same people were moved to tears by that very movie  and they re too embarrassed now to admit it i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time  expecting to simply enjoy the story again  i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years  i cried again     in all the same places  it brought me back to      when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time  a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall  yes  even more than star wars   and today  many people won t even admit they enjoyed it  folks  let s get something straight    you don t look cool when you badmouth this film  you look like an out of touch cynic no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults  some of the dialogue falls flat  and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly  however  none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful  leo is one of the fine actors of his generation  wait  til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy  kate winslet was so strong in this film  the movie really was hers  and she held it together beautifully james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic  the sinking scenes were horrific  just as they were that night  how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me  i was utterly transfixed this film is one memorable scene after another  titanic leaving port in southampton  rose and jack at the bow   flying    iceberg  right ahead   the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean  the screams of the doomed after she went down  and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears the music  which has also been a victim of the film s success  was a key ingredient  james horner s score was simply perfect  and the love theme was beautiful and tragic  too bad celine dion s pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many i confess  i am a titanic buff  as such  i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it    in all its beauty  perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i ve had such an interest in the ship all my life  however  i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs  i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy  the film was made with such humanity another reviewer said it better than i ever could  open up your hearts to titanic  and you will not be disappointed',1

'i am not a parent  neither am i a male  but i was able to identify with every character s heartaches and pains this is a movie teenagers should watch  maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again  i m sorry for those that don t understand the value of love  family and friendship it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing  and it is great to see a    year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance  he showed at an early age  that he is capable of heartfelt drama  he should be offered more serious roles  note hollywoodland    his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in      this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages  maybe shouldn t be watched by children under    because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families  but i recommend it to the entire family i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times  because it portrays the values that are important in life',1

'daniell steel s daddy  what a refreshing story  this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children  how rare is that  in these times of  heather has two mommies   or what ever  you fill in the blanks  it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone  with the father s roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga  how disappointing to have it end  every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role  i would have loved to see each character develop over the years  i loved this movie  it is one i will defiantly watch every time it s on  good story  good acting  and i hope this isn t a spoiler  but no obtrusive sex or bad language  yes it touched my heart  warning  get the kleenex ready  what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment  be it television or  movie s  daniell if your listening  you go girl  give us more',1

'i must admit  when i read the description of the genre on netflix as  steamy romance  i was a little bit skeptical   steamy   in a movie from        i was prepared for disappointment  and when i realized it was shot entirely in black   white  i knew my erotic hopes were dashed boy  was i wrong  not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance    the discovery of first love  fear of the secret being found out  a sudden unexpected end    but at times this movie was downright erotic  you will soon forget that it is shot in black   white  the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years  and the performances from the two stars  essy persson and anna gael  are intense and memorable  ok  so they re both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls  it s       do you really expect teenagers from the    s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this  many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then  anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much i think this movie was way ahead of its time  the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure  yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination  opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here  as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action  although it won t be all you expect  i don t think you ll be too  too disappointed',1

'this is a superb movie  suitable for all but the very youngest  though accessibility for younger people was marred  at least in the print which i saw  by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub titling  for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time period it is set   there is no modern technology shown  not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle  just a drab  almost monochrome  everyday life  against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks  even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war  this could still be any time in the past     years but then we briefly see a motor car   late   s  early   s style   and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals  and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war   and the communist revolution which makes the central character s desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today  both within china and in other parts of the world  the inequality between boys and girls  men and women  the trade  for various purposes  in young children  corruption in society  injustice  the importance of friendship maybe i m reading too much into this film  but i don t think so  i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom  whilst dross is passed off as quality material but don t get me started on that',1

'king of masks  bian lian in china  is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film  winner of    awards from around the world  this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian  a street performer in     s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face change opera  he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance  and no one knows how he does it  he has a longing desire to have a grandson  as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir  we then go to the streets  and see that people are selling their children because they can t afford to take care of them  some are even begging to take their daughters for free  because daughters are not worth much in this society  wang bianlian s story goes on from there the film was so astonishingly good  the acting was amazing  and the issues were so weighty and well addressed  there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place  no one wants a little girl  also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman  and while he is famous and well respected  he regards himself as something low  a half woman  as we go further into the film  the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it  the brutality and corruption of the military and police  and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life  and xu zhu  the actor who plays wang bianlian  presents yet another beautiful performance',1

'this is how movies are supposed to be made  a fascinating setting  characters about whom you come to care deeply  writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense  this is a wonderful film    deeply moving without being sentimental  highly recommended',1

'this movie was excellent  a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes  this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie  you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way  doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions  this equals on big happy movie in the end  this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be  so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets  you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture  the cinema photography is excellent  in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers  bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film',1

'this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone  but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation  women and performers  both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star  are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china  this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors  performance a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies',1

'robert a  heinlein s classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years  in everything to paul verhoeven s      film to a tv series  to a number of games  but none of these  so to speak  has really captured the spirit of his novel  the games are usually unrelated  the tv series was more of a spin off  and the less said about verhoeven s film  the better  little do most know  however  that in japan  an animated adaptation had already been done  released the year of heinlein s death  and  believe it or not  despite its differences  this   part animated series is  plot wise  the most faithful adaptation of heinlein s classic the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons  something we were deprived of in verhoeven s film  like the book  the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel  though we see a fair amount of each  while events happen differently than in the book  the feel of the book s plot is present  rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement  but it s only slightly more touched upon than in the book  while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book  it gets a bit of the anime treatment  but what did you expect    but it s far superior to the film  heinlein s political views are merely excised  as opposed to the film  where they are reversed  the big payoff of the series  however  is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs aliens  which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version overall  i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein  and i think they did pretty well with this  if you can find this series  give it a look',1

'as i was watching this film on video last night  i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure  i ve a feeling i ll be watching this again and again for years to come it s got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story film  and even though some cultural references are obscure for me  a western viewer  at the core this is a universal tale',1

'when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir  the aging and very proud street performer  known to all as  the king of masks   becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate his warmth and humanity  tho  find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china s devastating natural disasters  in this case  massive flooding in the      s he takes his new    year old companion  onto his straw houseboat  to live with his prized and beautiful monkey   general   only to discover that the he child is a she child his life is instantly transformed  as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man there are many stories inside this one   many people are touched  and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe  thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama  and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye the technical transfer itself is not that great  as i found the sound levels all over the meter  and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie  highly recommended          stars',1

'an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film shameful since it warrants having a wider audience a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told  although admittedly predictable in its resolution  solidly acted by the principals  beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film my recent foray into chinese film  shower  the road home  not one less  has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring  china and its people is an amazing canvas for film makers   the king of masks  can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film',1

'one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find  if you are lucky  in the video stores  is they are very accurate retellings of actual  true stories  farewell  my concubine  the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples  the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience    the hallmark of much hollywood  and especially disney films in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art  along an having lost his only son many years earlier  he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work  master wang is sold a son by a slave trader  all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art  but the son eventually is found out to be a girl  from there  the story get very interesting  with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera    a regional operatic style related to peking opera  fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liang s portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera  it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati  but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality',1

'masks  is a moving film that works on many levels  at its simplest  it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art  masks  to the next generation  although  at times the story makes the old man into a job  it is so well crafted  written  acted  directed  wonderful production values   it is easy to move beyond his plight  and  if you hang with it  the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting  kudos all around  this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults  the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it',1

'beautiful and touching movie  rich colors  great settings  good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while  i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china  my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too',1

'this is probably my favorite movie of all time  it is perfection in its storytelling  it will break your heart not because it s over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through  you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time',1

'it s a tale that could have taken place anywhere really  given the right circumstances  street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing  the aging entertainer finds buys a male child to pass his art to  from there  we follow them through the rigors of their challenging  but free life along the river  traveling town to town  he performs and has some degree of notoriety  despite the times and the influences  the man is kind and good overall  the performances are first rate  especially xu zhu  who portrays the street performer  the child  renying zhou  is beautiful  and downright strong  and withstands the overt prejudices well  the two protagonists  along with supporting help from the kind opera singer  master liang  an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang   paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness  sadness and love  some have mentioned this film s remote similarities to ba wang bie ji  farewell my concubine   yet this film can t stand easily on its own  any resemblance is remote at best my only qualm with the king of masks  is the ending  it was weak  cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer  the audience was already wrapped up in the story  what was the needless manipulation for  what a shame  to bring a fine motion picture that far  only to surrender to emotional  and corny  pathos like that  it frankly made this film good  instead of the classic  it should ve been  that aside  the king of masks is still very well worth your time  i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films  highly recommended',1

'i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the     s in this beautiful film  the story is simple  an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children  the faces of the actors are marvelous to see  the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well  the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine  which was more sophisticated and intricate  the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel  the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism  humanity  and history portrayed',1

'ok  let s get this clear  i m really not into sci fi  but for some reason i love stargate sg   jack o neil takes his team sg   through a stargate  a round device that creates a wormhole  it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds  it might sound like your usual sci fi series  but it s not  the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci fi series  i find that great  it gives you things  happenings and such you can relate to  and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets  they have some of course but thanks to o neil who likes to keep a simple terminology  there s not many the series has a nice blending of action  humor and drama  if you enjoy loads of special effects you re not going to find it here  they don t use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects',1

'in the rapid economic development of      s in china  there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture  partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth  and more importantly  due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural revolutionary era however  the resurgence of chinese traditional culture  namely  the confucianism  was not without disasters  because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part  and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example moreover  not only the part that should be discarded were inherited  the good part that was supposed to be inherited  such as the traditional opera  and its technique  such as changing face  was ignored in the resurgence  and facing extinction the director used this film to criticize the problem of re embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie',1

'this is a beautiful  rich  and very well executed film with a rich and meaningful story  basically  it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a  male  heir to carry on his craft  but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male dominated world  the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society s traditional notions the story is fun  emotional  and complex  the exploration of the characters  their lives  and emotions  is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all  the film expertly conveys the old man s emotions and his desire to find an heir  and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation  there is also humour  sometimes quite subtle  at appropriate points  the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture  creating further interest and depth to the film the directing  acting  and scenery are all outstanding  added to the other strengths  this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling  real characters  as a result  the film evokes strong empathy for  and feelings about  the characters some have claimed that the ending weakens the film  but i do not necessarily agree  perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending  but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small',1

'the movie is truly poignant  unique and uplifting  the story is universal in that it s a battle between good  evil and the world between  the most important thing is that its rating is wrong  misleading  and a travesty  blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie  the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub titles',1

'this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen  it shows a china i had never seen or imagined  and i believe it shows      s china in the most real light ever seen in a movie  it is absolutely heart breaking in so many situations  seeing how hard life was for the characters  and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful  you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film  the actors are all perfect  such that you feel like you have really entered a different world i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough  it may just change you forever once you have seen it',1

'i just saw this movie today with my children  son     and daughter       at the  rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival  after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director  tian ming wu  he  through a translator  told several stories about his life and the making of the film all tangents aside  both of my children really enjoyed this movie  of course  i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter  but much of the film is visually self explanatory i won t give anything away  but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than     of the hollywood crap  especially children s films  out there cheers p s  there is a  real  original king of masks who can could do    masks at once  the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to   masks at a time  then they would cut and change to   new masks',1

'fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest the sfx are very good for a movie of its age  and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors  even down to body type  a rarity in movies of this vintage a cozy movie  with splendid panoramas    even when chopped down to pan and scan',1

'i got in to this excellent program in about season   and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of   and     it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after    seasons  sadly now the sci fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a    season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more  atlantis is still going strong on its  th seasons  and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead  this tv show is a must see for all sci fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it',1

'i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue  but was pleased to find a fast paced script  an underlying moral  excellent portrayals from all the actors  especially peter finch  amazing special effects  suspense  and beautiful cinematography  there s even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban  not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic  before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work  all the supporting players round it out  and i do wonder who trained all those elephants speaking of the stone buddha sequence  you really can discern that it s vivien leigh in the long shots  her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor s  the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots  where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk if you want a thought provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring  spend a few hours with elephant walk',1

'the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon  current day sri lanka   upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd  william dieterle  who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie   does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark  and almost eerie  undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i ve seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery',1

'one of the first ova s   original video animation   i ever bought  this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles  a cyberpunk sci fi action comedy set against an unlikely  for a comedy  that is  background of near future pollution in a dystopian society the  heroes  of dominion are the tank police  formed with a  if we can t beat crime  we ll get bigger guns  philosophy  and who are  like the name suggests  patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars  and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch  most  if not all  of these cops are borderline    psychopaths and neurotics  giving new meaning to the phrase  loose cannons  equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries  terrorist buaku and his hench wo men  the twin cat sisters  whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time the animation is not state of the art  but it s very nice otherwise  the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion the english dubbing is  again  lots of fun  the soundtrack of the english version is also very good  i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that   anyway  dominion tank police is great  it s japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy  filled with completely over the top characters and situations  making sure that it never takes itself seriously  highly recommended',1

'dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt  one of the most amazing shows ever produced  but not just in the field of animation  while the first part  acts   and    mostly consists of action and fun  the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part  the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant  you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part  acts   and     i do have some complaints though  in the first part  the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all  one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool  buaku rules',1

'fact  stargate sg   is a cheesy sci fi tv series there s no escaping facts  how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg   remains a cheesy sci fi tv series stargate sg   does borrow and steal ideas briskly  special fx aren t nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn t going to blow you out of the chair  or couch for that matter either but  and this is where i really think stargate sg   deserves all the credit it can get  for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci fi movie that s actually worse than a one hour tv episode in fact some episodes actually could probably have been    minutes long and still have been better than most movies and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg   special i am very picky with my selections  i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg   as yet another tacky sci fi show  don t  stick with it and you ll see what i m talking about',1

'i stumbled across this  act i  by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago  this was nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned  it amazed me  it intimidated me  it shocked me  i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later  i happened to think about it again  then went and bought both acts  they were even better than i had experienced at first my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime  warranting tanks and heavy artillery  it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals  that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time  if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda  it certainly has not been shown as such i don t think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this  but regarding the story  there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused',1

'dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making  the storyline across the   parts blends mindless action  slap stick humor  touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions  it s hard to believe that there was only one director  as the style changes from episode to episode  a must see movie for anyone who likes anime',1

'after  aakrosh    this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence  it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released  this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like coolie    betaab   hero  in      smithapatel  in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him  she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs at one time she even gave up her love when the hero s ruthlessness touched the roof top there was another character in this movie  which was played by om puri contemporary  naseeruddin shah he played as an inspector turned alcoholic character the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero s ending in his debut film sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent  the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani s other film  drohkaal   even after two decades  this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew  each one played their part par excellence',1

'ardh satya  is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema  directed by the great director govind nihalani  this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success  even today  ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india the film tells the real life scenario of mumbai police of the   s  unlike any police of other cities in india  mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether  govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment amongst various police officers   colleagues  the film describes the story of anand velankar  a young hot blooded cop coming from a poor family  his father is a harsh police constable  anand himself suffers from his father s ideologies   incidences of his father s atrocities on his mother  anand s approach towards immediate action against crime  is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction  the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors this leads to frustrations  as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction  resulting from the frustrations  his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms   bars  also turning him to an alcoholic the spirit within him is still alive  as he constantly fights the system  he is aware of the system of the metro  where the police   politicians are a inertly associated by far end  his compromise towards unethical practice is negative  finally he gets suspended the direction is a master piece   thoroughly hard core  one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty s house to arrest him  followed by short conversation which is fantastic  at many scenes  the film has hair raising moments the practical approach of script is a major punch  alcoholism  corruption  political influence  courage  deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today  those aspects are dealt brilliantly finally  the films belongs to the one man show  om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly',1

'an absolute classic    the direction is flawless   the acting is just superb  words fall short for this great work  the most definitive movie on mumbai police  this movie has stood the test of times om puri gives a stellar performance  smita patil no less  all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment  this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society this is the story of a cop  om puri   who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer  the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops  kudos to nihalani   after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal politician police nexus  thus this movie was truly a trend setter  this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade this movie was a moderate box office hit a must see for discerning movie fans',1

'any story comprises a premise  characters and conflict  characters plotting their own play promises triumph  and a militant character readily lends oneself to this  ardh satya s premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by dilip chitre  the line goes    ek palde mein napunsaktha  doosre palde mein paurush  aur teek tarazu ke kaante par  ardh satya     a rough translation    the delicate balance of right   wrong   commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts   has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another  is the needle on the center a half truth    the poem is recited midway in the film by smita patil to om puri at a resturant  it makes a deep impact on the protagonist   lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow  at the end of the film  om puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem the film tries mighty hard to do a one up on the poem  however  chitre s words are too powerful  and at best  the film matches up to the poem in every aspect',1

'i loved this film  not being a swooning ed wood jr  fan  i prefer to appreciate his  boundless enthusiasm  and acknowledge his shortcomings  his movies are fun  but his personal story is one racked with pain  i hoped  and was delighted to find  that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life  rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise  from beginning to end  this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology  leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives  positive and negative  and showing us their character as much as ed s  we get insight into ed s personal and professional life  from his romances  to his drinking  to his sexuality  to his friends  to his enemies  and even to his film making the film itself is shot in a low budget way that seems done out of respect for ed  as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from      would be disrespectful  sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president   the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies  and new comers will be amazed that this man was real  the dvd is full of impossible to find gems   crossroads of lorado  and photo galleries   but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him  for better or worse   to the point where one woman will go down in history as  swimming pool owner  for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool  this ability to define a person s legacy comes through universally  as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr   but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created  somehow  without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time  the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear  and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement even the title hints at the b list horror genre  but by the end  we see that even this is a kindness  what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood s legend in many ways a living contradiction  ed wood jr  could not be condensed to a single viewpoint  this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get  being itself a juxtaposition of themes  it is at once respectful  provocative  thoughtful  gripping  fun  sad  kind  and fulfilling',1

'the haunted world of edward d  wood  jr   is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as  glen or glenda    bride of the monster   and  of course   plan   from outer space   this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries  such as  look back in angora  and  the plan   companion   failed  it rounds up his surviving entourage  many of whom have passed away since filming  and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work  nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood  sentimental in its treatment of the director  down to the haunting music   this documentary is an absolute must see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day  the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed s life and untimely death for the viewer  best watched at   am while wearing an angora sweater',1

'this film deals with the atrocity in derry    years ago which is commonly known as bloody sunday the film is well researched  acted and directed  it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry  the film puts the atrocity into context of the time  it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity  the disgraceful white wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt with overall  this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking  when the saville report comes out  watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is',1

'an excellent and accurate film    mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off  he is not afraid to tell the truth  even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy once again  mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston  though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough  i found this movie as accurate  well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing  well done and my hat is off to the writer  the actors  the production crew  a great film',1

'the story of a drifter  his sheep ranch boss  and the boss s daughter is not for all tastes  but it s still very intriguing  it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand  amongst the scenery we ve come to know so well through other films from this region this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan  and i ve been a fan of hers ever since  the cast also contains bruno lawrence  who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film  smash palace   terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter  regan  sharply acted  with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads  i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america  but believe you me  the unexpurgated version is not to be missed',1

'while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike s later films this is a very good crime drama the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster  complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang  the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust  its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film  it is a very very good one  this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don t mind a no frantic pace a word of warning  the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty  there are also semi graphic depictions of gay sex  if thats not your cup of tea  proceed with caution   or   out of',1

'shinjuku triad society  chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals  why  could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk  and the victims enjoy it  or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull  these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story  it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon should you see this film  yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema  the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters  if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar  barring the insane ending in doa of course   great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano  the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd  if i haven t put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i m sure it will come out in that country',1

'shinjuku triad society  albeit from perfect  is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber conventional realm  it s a yakuza triad picture  involving cops versus japanese   or chinese gangsters  mostly chinese  as the title suggests   but already even in his first technical  debut   takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here on in  social issues like black market trading of precious goods  in this case human organs usually from children  nostalgia for childhood and one s roots  which was especially prevalent in dead or alive    thumbing of the nose at taboos like gay sex and  satirical  rape violence towards women  blood curdling violence  it s certainly not as surreal as some of miike s most recent films  but this is expected as he s trying out things that he s just starting to learn  following a track record of straight to video programmers  it s got all of those qualities  and it s also  like the films that would follow from it  equally savage and heartfelt  crazy  in spots  and sardonic in its drama  and solid for genre fans the story concerns two brothers  one a chinese orphan raised in japan  tatsuhito kiriya  kippei shiina  pretty decent as a eastwood esquire anti hero hero   who s become a detective  and another  who s become a gangster  or a would be one  the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang  a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare time  played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes   and his partner karino  takeshi caesar  who s threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who s just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal   who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie  there s some intrigue involving the organ trading scheme with the gangsters  which kiriya almost becomes a victim of  and the gang s penchant for gay sex  at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want  it all leads up to vengeance and redemption  qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare  hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying  it won t come off   if it doesn t add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have  it s par for the course of a film like this  miike s goals are met  though just met  in his low scale ambitions  a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble  the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents   notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime  and what the realm of unrepentant sex  with both sexes  brings out psychologically in the characters  at the same time  shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black comedy from the miike oeuvre  some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness  like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face  or the randomness of the  interrogation  as it goes into a very twisted area  there s even a laugh out loud line from the young sex slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses   thank you  mr  weeny burger   miike and his writer don t have enough here to make the film a full on dark comedy like ichi or  of course  visitor q  but there s enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters as the first entry of the  black society  trilogy  as it s called  i was quite impressed  and it s a fine quasi calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema',1

'this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy  and the trilogy kicks of to a great start  the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically  and these themes are actually apparent in all his films  if you look close enough  shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders  struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza  the kid brother is a lawyer  and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one  as the movie progresses  the movie takes place in a very harsh environment  and is therefore pretty violent and tough  miike has done worse  but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard  as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex  mostly homosexual in this one  the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie  but with a great drive and true grittiness  if you ve only seen miikes far out movies  ichi the killer  fudoh etc   this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over the top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side  as seen in the other films of the trilogy  and as always with miike  there are at least two scenes in this that you ll never forget  see it and figure out which ones for yourself',1

'a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true  miike  film and i thought this sort of description might have been a clich  but  like all clichs  it is based on the truth  all the miike trademarks are here  the violence  the black humour  the homosexuality  the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character  shinjuku is however  one of miike s most perfectly formed films  he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different  but not necessarily better  i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film as you might expect  the violence is utterly visceral  gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face   only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that   the film has a fantastic pace  unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle  dead or alive also deals with similar issues  miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here  the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past i cannot sing shinjuku s praises enough  i do not want to give away too much  this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano s sonatine  the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you ll be popping it back on again to work it all out',1

'this was the beginning of it all  granted  this is not friends at its best  but this was the show s pilot  let s not forget and not a bad one at that  we re introduced to the gang and central perk  where our story begins  even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years  when ross says   i just want to be married again  and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on    probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back  something else   in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes  the so called  flashbacks  this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions  nevertheless  the point is this a fine start to a great show  this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them  with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was  keep watching  first season is a blast',1

'stargate sg   is a spin off of sorts from the      movie  stargate   i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject  the show gets it rolling from the very first episode  a retired jack o neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion  dr  daniel jackson  through the first two episodes  we meet samantha carter  a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her  and there is teal c  a quiet  compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team the main bad guys are called the gouald  they are parasites who can get inserted into one s brain  thus controlling them and doing evil deeds  any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a  system lord   the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa  who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a person s brain through the episodes  we mostly get to see sg    the exploratory team comprised of jack daniel teal c and sam  go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets  this device is called the stargate  and they encounter new cultures or bad guys  some episodes are on world  meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth through the years  you start to see a decline in the sg   team as close knit  and more character building story lines  this  in turn means even more on world episodes  which is perfectly understandable my rating             while most of this show is good  there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years  but still  top notch science fiction',1

'the pilot is extremely well done  it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes  i don t think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show  it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part  although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode  a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot  an example would be ross and rachels future relationship  even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared  it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice bravo a great start to an unbeatable comedy',1

'in the very first episode of friends  which aired    sept       the one where monica gets a roommate  there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show  the line that plays is   if you ever need holding      does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song  it is seems as if it is a great song    i would love to get a copy of it  thanks for the assistance  i am looking for the album cd it is on so i can purchase it i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again  it just seemed to be believable   thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years',1

'well its about time  i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season s entries  while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries  at least this episode turned out well  its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season  in  right to die  we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey  at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation  abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back  while they speak  they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises  but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire  and this is just the setup people  once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes  there s also a side effect too  every time she flatlines  abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people  hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever  from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it  right to die should have the right to go on living forever',1

'a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident  when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state  the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live  the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him this comes to us from director rob schmidt  who made  wrong turn   a film i have not seen   with only one horror film under his belt  and not a particularly notorious one at that  i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode  expecting schmidt to be a  master of horror  in only the most liberal sense  my apologies to him for my underestimation  as of episode    in a    episode season  this was actually the best one yet the issue of the  right to die  is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device  however  this is only the foundation on which the story revolves  once the horror elements show up  the film goes from  decent  to  spectacular   great acting  great plot  great dialogue  great suspense  i was a little creeped out at times  which is good  and most of all  the gore is in extreme abundance  i read a review of this episode prior to watching it  where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of  hellraiser  in this  through the first part of the show  i had no idea what they were talking about  then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of  hellraiser     however  i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film  i can see no other way to create the effect that was created  and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than  hellraiser    some plot twists show up later on  and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look  i didn t watch it a second time  but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had  not that it s confusing   the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice  and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him  he s somewhat of an anti hero to the whole story  if you will  i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist  but he s completely unlovable while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i m excited about the  washingtonians  episode  i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine  when legends like john carpenter let me down  again  i get a bit worried about the genre s future  but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope  this one is a keeper  and please bring schmidt back for season',1

'fans of the hbo series  tales from the crypt  are going to love this moh episode  those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on  will recognize this one right off the bat underrated indie favorite martin donovan  also an excellent writer   co author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her  is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way  he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy next door  or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness  in the case of right to die  he takes the latter approach  and it definitely works donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist  robin sydney   much to the displeasure of his inconsolable  unforgiving spouse  abbey  julia anderson   when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of  making up   and she s horribly burned in a fire  he s reluctant to pull the plug on her  not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy  corbin bernsen  looking the worse for wear these days  but abbey s never been one to give up without a fight  and that s where the ec theme of the episode comes in  cuckolded husbands   and wives   have always been the genre s favorite subject matter for some spooky  and ooky  supernatural shenanigans  and this case is definitely no exception  if anything  the ramped up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere and that s not to mention that john esposito s original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist  you don t realize as you re watching that you only know half the story  until close to the end    think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas  and you re there  not a bad effort  but not the best of the lot  either  at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction  especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed  as with most moh episodes  this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment  so the extremely squeamish need not apply',1

'i was all ready to pan this episode  seeing that this  master  really doesn t have any horror films under his belt   but this is easily the best episode of the season the acting was good   i don t know how he wrangled it  but we ve got some real talent in this episode  and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise  at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full    mins  something that has been lacking up to this point in the series i especially liked the bit at the end  not a twist per say  but just a funny little bit where he becomes  as ever  the hen pecked hubby really good effort  like i ve said in other reviews  these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes   but they may someday end up being masters in the future',1

'maybe it s just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff  but this one got under my skin  pardon the pun   this piece is brave  not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies  not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the  screwee   i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself  some parts are very reminiscant of  hellraiser   but come off as tribute rather than imitation  it s a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider  but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile  this piece brings it and doesn t appologize  i liked this one a lot  do not watch whilst eating pudding',1

'this was a superb episode  one of the best of both seasons  down right horror for a change  with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes  if there is such a thing  a man s wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck  in which he was driving  his airbag worked  her s didn t  she is burned beyond recognition  great makeup btw   and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft  but  even in a coma  she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology  and when she does die for a few minutes  her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit  carnage of course ensues  and also some extremely gory killings  and also  some extremely sexy scenes  what more could you ask for  you might ask  well  not much  because this baby has it all  and a very satirical ending  that should leave a smile on most viewers faces  i just loved rob schmidt s  wrong turn  direction too  he has a great knack for horror  excellent episode  this is one i m buying for sure',1

'but the fun is in the journey i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable  not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes  the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times yes  it s predictable  and yes  it s a clich romantic comedy  but the point is that it s a sweet story  the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways the dialog is dead on and the acting is well done on all parts  and over the top for comic effect  the bulgari scene is worth it s weight in gold  the actress there deserves honorable mention  for those that panned it for being predictable   if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing    then you want a thriller  this is a romantic comedy    it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life  and it has been worth every effort along the way great date movie  great movie for a happy cry',1

'this is a really old fashion charming movie  the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies  fi you want to watch a movie that doesn t demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it  the acting is good  and i really liked michael rispoli  he was in rounders  too  and while you were sleeping  the rest of the cast is fun  it s just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings  i know    sounds kooky    but it is  and that s what makes it fun to watch  it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you  but at least you ll know',1

'i d have given this film a few stars  simply because it was a  lifetime  presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story   here  new york city  most on this channel  whether  set  there  in rural iowa  oregon  virginia  l a  etc   are filmed in vancouver  ottawa  toronto or some other canadian locale but if there ever were one deserving the top rating       on this site  it s this movie  certainly not for originality  for this story has been done many times  in many variations  with several very similar to this specific one  it s also been done pretty often on the big screen  with mega stars  past and present  from cary grant  james garner  harrison ford  tom hanks  et al   and deborah kerr  doris day  meg ryan  and many more  i can think of at least       more  just as prominent  past to present  off the top of my head  who could be added now  and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind not to drone on  but my point is that  in my opinion  this is by far one of the best of this genre i ve seen  i caught it by chance on a mid day friday  at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week  i d never run across this flick in the   years since it was made  and  while the two leads have done enough to be known to most  they were completely unknown to me  the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman  anna s mother  whom i d seen in some things from her younger days  and michael rispoli  henry  charlie s best friend  who was outstanding as  gramma   the menacing juice loan  tough  street guy from  rounders  the chance meeting and coupling between both leads  best friends  as a sub story romance  with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later  is an oft done plot contrivance within the genre  but makes no difference to the enjoyment here  in fact  it enhances it  checking some other comments  i agree completely with those which are the most positive  the primary word describing this film is engaging  in caps  this adjective describes the performers  the characters  the chemistry between and among all of the characters  in whatever combination presented  and all of the supporting and even minor roles i love films with a  harder edge    rounders   the escapist schwarzenegger stallone fare   goodfellows   even the classics like  casablanca    gone with the wind    citizen kane   but for pure  uncomplicated enjoyment  this one was outstanding  with a bare fraction of their budgets  it was equal to the results achieved by  you ve got mail  and  sleepless in seattle   and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn t have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here  the co stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega films  as well',1

'it s amazing that from a good  though not wonderful  film made back in the early nineties  a whole franchise can grow   stargate  sg   is  without a doubt  a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder to shoulder with  star trek  as the kings of sci fi following on from the      feature film  stargate   this series sees stargate command  a military science organisation  figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore  sg  is one such team  headed by military veteran colonel jack o neill  and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson  military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal c  who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people  earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa uld  a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods the top notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life  richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o neill  who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye  michael shanks  as daniel  brings heart and an will of steel to the character  who has grown from wide eyed innocence to darker and more hard bitten as the show has progressed  amanda tapping  as carter  has perfected the balance between depicting her character s femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong  intelligent military scientist  christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal c  who is able to depict the character s emotions with subtlety  and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence  reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs  often shown through arguments between o neill and jackson   guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn t bore viewers  sg  also excels in humour  from o neill s wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd  sg  has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death  it isn t just an excellent sci fi show but is an excellent show  overall',1

'sure  this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichs  but it s entertaining  and that s what i watch movies for  to be entertained  natasha henstridge is stunning  even with the short hair  her smile is radiant and her beauty can t be disguised  as for michael vartan  i m sure the women love him  the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film  i don t understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them  i guess we see what we want to see olivia d abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch  even if d abo s british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech  to tell you the truth i hadn t really noticed it until i read these comments  but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me  but she was ideal for her role with that one exception it s a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others  but who find their soul mates in one another  it may be an unlikely story  but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries  it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube  that s why we watch them  to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen  i thought these actors did a good job of it  but hey  i m a sentimental guy who tears up easily  don t get me wrong though  it has to be a sentimental scene  and this movie had plenty of those i give it      only because i m saving my       for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day  if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies  or whatever  make a note to watch it  i think you ll like it',1

'a beautiful postcard of new york  the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear  it never did  my teenagers liked it too  my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan  my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something  this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done  the ending came with a twist which we all liked too  if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you  as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did  i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch',1

'i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work  finally found it yesterday         on lifetime movie channel jim larson s comments about it being a  sweet funny story of   people crossing paths  were dead on  writers probably shouldn t get a bonus  everyone else sro for making the movie anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it natasha s screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric  to say nothing of her beauty  that anything she is in goes on my favorite list  her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for god bless her  her family and future endeavors this movie doesn t seem to available in dvd or video yet  but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too',1

'this is the first michael vartan movie i ve seen i haven t seen alias  and i was curious to see if the guy can act he sure can and is likable in this movie natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles so i found her very good and lovable in this different sweet  role of a schoolteacher  some of the negative comments i read are true the movie is full of clichs and the story doesn t ring true at all also even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together i don t think there is screen chemistry there  however i enjoyed this movie the locales are nice the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good  if you are expecting to see a great romance this is not it but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good',1

'i just can t understand the negative comments about this film  yes it is a typical boy meets girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by  henstridge  talk about winning the gene pool lottery   is as magnetic and alluring as ever  who says the golden age of cinema is dead   and vartan holds his own there is simmering chemistry between the two leads  the film is most alive when they share a scene   lots  it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together   ignore the negative comments   if you are feeling a bit blue  watch this flick  you will feel so much better  if you are already happy  then you will be euphoric  ps  i am     male  from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess',1

'this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than   why not it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most like our churches the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians thanks fox for producing it as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves  in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright  honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith',1

'this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash  adorned in black  of course  who sings a lot and narrates a bit also  if you like johnny cash  this film is quite enjoyable  also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work   just for fun  try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair     anyway  its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all',1

'i wait for each new episode  each re run with anticipation  the new look of sci fi created by stargate sg   is a wonder that i hope will never end  to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me  season    should be a thrill in itself  i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season  as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o neill  the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner  season after season  you cancel this program in the next three years  and you make a serious mistake  also  you need a bigger role for the asgard   they are just too cool',1

'i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say  it was very  very good  on all fronts  script  cast  director  photography  and high production values  etc  proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston  who mug and call it acting  who da thunk it parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as  over her dead body   lake bell is excellent  too  and this is the first time i have seen her  and finally  paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie  instead of lesser films a movie like this never gets its dues from close minded males  it s too bad  as other imdb reviewers here have noted  there is nothing lame about this gem   no hack writing or acting and its depiction of contemporary l a  and california  in general  makes every scene look bright  beautiful  clean  and otherwise outstanding in every way  never before has a movie made l a  look so good  ah  what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie i won t divulge the plot  but as a long time and hard core atheist  i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light hearted piece of entertainment  it reminds me very much of the old  topper  movies  which were also so enjoyable this movie exposes popular  but otherwise hackneyed  movies like  ghost  for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are  we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre  some of us save our praise for the truly worthy  however if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as  into the night  with michelle pfeiffer  jeff goldblum and clu gulager   blind date  with bruce willis and kim basinger   american dreamer  with jobeth williams   chances are  with robert downey jr   christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard   making mr  right  with john malkovich  etc   you ll enjoy this a first rate job all around  even if it s kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years   but even that plot device doesn t detract from the movie s overall excellence',1

'ah  i loved this movie  i think it had it all  it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times  yes  i am a girl  so i m writing this from a girl s perspective  i think it s a shame it only scored     in rating  too many guys voting  it was far above other romantic comedies  just because i m female i don t enjoy all chic flicks  on the contrary i prefer other genres  romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be  but like i said  this movie had it all  almost  in my opinion  great script  good one liners  fine acting  although eva longoria parker s character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives  but so what  it was awesome  i will keep this film for rainy days  days when i feel low and need a few laughs',1

'this had a good story   it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool i ve watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i ve seen in the two weeks jason bigg s character was the best though even though it was small  it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning this may be a romantic comedy and i don t like most  but the writing  direction  performing  sound  design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool this film scored pretty high out of all the movie s i ve seen lately   and the rest were big budget or better publicized good job in writing',1

'i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full    vote if claudia black had not continued on in it  her inclusion as the silly  vela  has brought the series down in my estimation  to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of  jack  and really didn t need this great series turned into new episodes of  farscape  i was a great fan of the film  stargate  and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film  but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked  i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation',1

'in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review  this film actually was surprisingly good  i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichs  obvious jokes and overacting  all of which the trailer had promised however  after   minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting  with only one  toilet humour  gag  over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and  without spoiling anything too much  some of the moments involving animals are hilarious the staple ingredients of a good film are all there  script  director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy  this film stands tall sure  you aren t going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening  but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time',1

'friz freleng s  rumours  is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic inducing rumours during wartime  produced  as were all the snafu shorts  to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films   rumours  is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan  when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing  it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war  this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long  rubbery piece of baloney and several strange  fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country s military   rumours  is inventive  fast paced and funny  all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured   don t badmouth the military  message  it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts',1

'rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring  private snafu   the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed  animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros   termite terrace  including friz freleng  chuck jones  and carl stalling  the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu  and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel  i e  dr  seuss  the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery  using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example  he was the dope  the little twerp who would do everything you re not supposed to do  according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials  but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes  certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow   all for the greater good  of course as the title would indicate  this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors  the setting is an army camp  private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine  something you won t see in any other hollywood films of the era  and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling  we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted  then exaggerated  then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp  the imagery is indeed vivid  the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot  while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air  i e  balloon juice   a soldier  shoots his mouth off   cannon style  and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction  winged baloney  at that  panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized  coney island wiped out  enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn  and the japanese are in california  the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for  rumor itis  and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell this is a highly effective piece of work  the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy  and the message is still a valid one  in recent years we ve seen that catastrophic events  real or imagined  can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances  because the technology has improved  the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e mail  cellphones and blogging  consequently  rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn t feel at all dated  in fact it may be more timely than ever',1

'de grot  is a terrific dutch thriller  based on the book written by tim krabb  another of his books   het gouden ei  was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called  spoorloos    the vanishing   in       this one is not as good as that thriller  although much better than the american remake also called  the vanishing   but there are times it comes close especially the opening moments are terrific  we see a man  later we learn his name is egon wagter  fedja van hut   coming from a plane in thailand  when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border  these scenes are perfectly directed  photographed and acted  a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this  later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman  both stating that they have never done anything like this from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash forward  we see how egon  still as a child  here played by erik van der horst   befriends a guy named axel  as a kid played by benja bruijning   we learn how they grew up as friends  sort of  and how axel  as an adult played by marcel hensema  became a criminal  egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman  around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him the movie is chronological in a way  it shows egon and axel as kids  than as students  young adults  and in their mid thirties  but from time to time  like i said  the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again  every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults minor spoilers herein the title means  the cave   and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending  although it is in fact not that happy  like the beginning  the ending is terrific  the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes  only to come back at that point in the end  it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending  although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well',1

'de grot is a very good film  the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb  who also adapted this story for the screen  some really top class acting  not only by van hut  but especially by marcel hensema  who mostly did tv work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf  the film seems to kick of as a thriller  and sets an excellent mood  then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf  and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash back structure  which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character driven drama of the movie  in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending  that will grab audiences by their throats  make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie  a must see  especially if you liked  spoorloos   the vanishing s original screen adaptation',1

'i started watching the show from the first season  and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it  original movie was kind of childish  and i was just looking for some sci fi show while waiting for the bsg new season but after few episodes i became a fan  i ve loved the characters   the not so stupid as you think he is jack o neill  the not only smart samantha carter  the glorious teal c  women and kids favorite  and brilliant dr  daniel jackson of course  stories sometimes not serious  sometimes even ridiculous  but mostly it s not about technology or space fighting   it s about helping your friend  even risking your life for him  it s about  we don t leave anybody behind   struggling to the end when all hope is lost  about the free will  and all good qualities that makes a human   human and now it s breaking a record  going   th season  and still doing good',1

'i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought  hey  another film starring aishu and shah rukh  little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just    minutes  shakti is a film about a mother s love and endurance  it s a film about transformations  ignorance  coming of age  stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life  the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie  it s actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk s drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze  he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day  dressed scantily and begins to seduce him  the title of the song is  ishq kamina   loosely translated as  love s a bitch    and it is just plain smoking hot  don t miss it',1

'good movie  good music  good background and an acceptable plot  but the main point again as his movies tend to be  the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold  nana patekar  this may be his second best performance after parinda  others may disagree   although other movies are not far behind  one man that will never ever disappoint you good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without  you can see in his movies  others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins  but this man is really something elase the movie is cool  the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good  a must watch',1

'a strong woman oriented subject after long  director krishna vamsi s shakti  the power  the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevi s first home production  a story about a woman s fight against harsh injustice the story of the film revolves around nandini  karisma kapoor  who lives in canada with her two uncles  tiku talsania  jaspal bhatti   there she meets shekhar  sanjay kapoor   falls in love with him and they soon marry  their family is complete when nandini has a boy  raja  master jai gidwani   but their happiness is short lived  as the news of shekhar s ailing mother  deepti naval makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india  and that s when the problems start  from the moment they reachindia  both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere  they take a crowded train to reach shekhar s village and when they finally reach the station  they have to catch a long bus drive to his village  the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never ending drive  and unfortunately for them  a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus  fortunately  they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him  after that  they drive to the handing havel where shekhar  s father  narsimha  nana patekar  lives with his wife  deepti naval   nandani realized that her father in law is in command as soon as she enters the place  but her only solace is her mother in law s warm welcome living there  nandini learns of her father in laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him  the day she sees her father in law teach her son to throw a bomb  she loses it and lashes out against him  insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada  but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day  leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father in law  her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart wrenching film what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie  the only drawback is ismail darbar  s music  which fails to rise above the script  the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena  which has been composed by anu malik  another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast  karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother  she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal  second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film  his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he s shown his versatility once again with this role  sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors  deepti naval too is in top form and her pr climax showdown with nana is praiseworthy  shahrukh s cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he s been pulled in to get the required star value  though his role was not really required  he s done it well  overall  shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr release hype is sure to get it a good opening  shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up  so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least   reels to better the impact  shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch',1

'seeing this movie was the most fun i ve had at the cinema in a long time  however  i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film  because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied  this picture has everything any movie could ever have  it has characteristics of a romantic comedy  a political commentary  a thriller  a drama  an action movie  a musical  and an absurdist self conscious art film  it s all in there  adding up to a myth the basic premise is about an indian couple  nandini  karishma kapoor  and shekhar  sanjay kapoor   happily living in canada  who rush to india to visit the husband s parents after a disturbing news report  the rest of the story takes place in india  where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence  at one point  the story borrows from  not without my baby   but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions  including shah rukh khan s dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie  in fact  the two stars are on all the posters  but they appear really late in the film  and only shah rukh ends up being a real character  yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film  and she does an admirable job  having to link up the film s twists and turns with a show of believable emotion  another notable presence is nana patekar  who plays narsimha  the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar  nana patekar dominates every scene he s in with a scary but nuanced character the movie is not without its share of realism  violence is rampant  but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters  with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions  at times  this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic i have seen a share of bollywood releases  and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm  but  shakti  raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous  it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy  where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained  it is pure  gratuitous cinema  and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book  perhaps  the all important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind  but i came out of watching  shakti  exhilarated  making movies can be the most fun in the world',1

'okay  i know this does nt project india in a good light  but the overall theme of the movie is not india  it s shakti  the power of a warlord  and the power of a mother  the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth  then things go terribly wrong  the interaction between nandini and her father in law   the power of their dysfunctional relationship   and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie  shah rukh khan s performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor  it is easy to get caught up in the love  violence and redemption of lives in this film  and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax  the musical interludes are strengths  believable and well done',1

'the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother s love  the exceptional performances  the steady execution and the quite innovative script  the film tells the story of an indian woman  nandini  who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja  all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india  of whom she had not even known  is in troubles and the couple rush to india  when they get into the village  nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture  shekhar s family  ruled by his cruel  highly cynical and merciless father narasimha  lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless  nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home  but he is soon killed by his father s enemies  when she wants to leave  narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india  here starts the intense struggle which can be called  nandini vs  narasimha  india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film  but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas  so it may be even correct  the portrayal is in my view fair and not one sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent  such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world  the locations are amazing  the music is wonderful  and krishna vamshi s direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing  one thing that must be noted is the very ear pleasing background score by ismail darbar  it is beautiful  the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film  portrayed realistically throughout  the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch  its dialogues are superb and intelligently written  and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points  a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension the film s biggest strength is the performances  karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini  her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible  she displays so much intensity  impulsiveness  anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son  her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child  after fiza  this is her most powerful performance  one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen  nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha  he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him  patekar displays cruelty  wittiness and even humanity with total conviction  he is outstanding  another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india s most underrated actress  deepti naval  who sensitises her character to perfection  sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief  anyway  do watch shakti   it could have been better  but it is definitely a must watch',1

'the movie was sub par  but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci fi fans ideal program  the actors deliver and the special effects  for a television series  are spectacular  having an intelligent interesting script doesn t hurt either stargate sg  is currently one of my favorite programs',1

'what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band  this disc is not for the faint of heart   the music is incredibly intense  and very cool  what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long  it is true that their records were great  but their shows were the top of the heap  in      when this concert was shot  the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands  and audiences  had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity  something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina  what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise  try the concert out  it really is amazing',1

'this is the who at their most powerful  although before the masterwork who s next  which would provide anthems like baba o reily and wont get fooled again  this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the    s daltrey shows what being a front man is all about  entwistle steady as ever moon is great  check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech  and see him playing  side saddle  whilst having a bass drum head replaced townsend even looks like he s enjoying himself occasionally considering they took to the stage at  am no one in the crowd was asleep there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in    years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one',1

'this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as  mitchell in malta   at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit   not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger  mitchell being mitchell  the film wouldn t have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either  oh well  at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst  i can t imagine watching it on it s own  however',1

'joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material  and almost always under appreciated  he s been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero  and has the type of strong  solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him  baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor  and that s what s so great about him  he really seems to mean what he s saying  regardless of how clich  obvious or silly  which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones  oliver reed and don stroud  it s what made the walking tall trilogy work so well  and that same magic is here in final justice  this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the   s  and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era  by moving the action from texas to europe  there s a real timeless quality that doesn t jar you away from the action on screen  to be honest  i ve always enjoyed the films of greydon clark  who is a no nonsense director in the same vein as     s clint eastwood  and this is one of his best  final justice is one of the lost gems of the late   s  similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence  i suppose if they remake this with the rock  a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do',1

'kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie  panaghoy sa suba is very good    it has the drama  the action  the romance  and scene that will make you laugh while the story is not that original  a love triangle    or make a four cornered love  japanese occupation  rebellion  american as lord   its presentation is something cool  especially it uses it original language    bisaya for the filipino  nipongo for the japanese and english for the american this movie will go as one of this year s best pinoy movies go watch this',1

'i m grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once moribund visayan film understorey   panaghoy  is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular  that claims more speakers than tagalog   the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines  downside  the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist  the other item that i didn t appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the  period  costume of the same character  and above all  his bright red kit car that i suppose was meant to pass for a     s roadster  without those small yet glaring details   panaghoy  would ve been at least a   out of    on my rating  daghang salamat  manoy cesar  addendum  this film sure beats peque gallaga s  oro  plata  mata   which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war  alos  there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg s  the color purple  and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of  noli me tangere',1

'on sunday july           the first episode of a new science fiction series called  stargate sg    was broadcast on showtime  a spin off of and sequel to the      film  stargate  starring kurt russell and james spader  the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film  for ten seasons  it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg    originally  the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o neill  two  l s    michael shanks as dr  daniel jackson  amanda tapping as captain samantha carter  christopher judge as teal c and don s  davis as major general george s  hammond  for ten long years  we watched the team battle against the goa uld  the replicators  the ori and many other aggressors  at the same time  they forged alliances with the asgard  the tok ra  the rebel jaffa  the nox and the tollan  they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up  not until death claimed them  and sometimes not even then as with all long running series  they were numerous cast changes  michael shanks left the series in january      at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor  daniel jackson s successor as the team s resident archaeologist geek was jonas quinn  an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara  played by corin nemec  however  shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june      and nemec left at the same time  unfortunately  he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards  don s  davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march      as he felt that it was time for him to go  the show s original star and arguably its most popular actor  richard dean anderson  starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons  his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons  he finally left  sg    in march      in order to spend more time with his then six year old daughter  jack o neill was by far my favourite character in the series and  truth be told  i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason the ninth season represented a new era for the programme  with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa uld and the replicators in season eight  many fans felt the series should go out on a high  regardless  the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa uld as the series  main adversaries  three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re invention  ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt  colonel cameron mitchell  the new leader of sg    his  farscape  co star  the lovely claudia black  began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious  sexy  hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran  a former goa uld host and con artist from another planet  a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons  she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season  rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry  the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o neill and general hammond  for the last two years  they starred alongside the  sg    faithful  michael shanks  amanda tapping and christopher judge  and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise alas  all good things must come to an end  during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten  ratings dropped considerably  resulting in cancellation in its august       after ten seasons and     episodes  the dream was finally over  on march           what began with  children of the gods  ended with  unending   the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci fi channel in the united states on june          in the ten years that the series was on the air  it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series   star trek   in terms of popularity in certain countries  it became the second longest running sci fi series in the world  second only to  doctor who               and the longest running american produced sci fi series  having surpassed  the x files  only a few months before it ended  stargate sg    represents the cornerstone of the  stargate  franchise  in       its success and popularity led to the production of a spin off series entitled  stargate atlantis   which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and     episodes in august       although plans for another feature film fell through  two direct to dvd films   stargate  the ark of truth  and  stargate continuum   were released in      and more are planned for the not too distant future  a third live action series   stargate universe   is also due to premiere at some point next year   there was  unfortunately  an animated series   stargate infinity   which ran only from      to      but the less said about that the better   despite the end of  sg    and  atlantis  as continuing series  the future of  stargate  looks very bright indeed in conclusion  while  stargate  has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci fi television franchises such as  star trek  and  doctor who   its still relatively new compared to those two sci fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many  many years to come',1

'imdb lists this as      for some reason  but the other sources i ve seen including the excellent program notes mark it as      doesn t really matter  except that it s quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video  one of the first art works to merge the two apparently  in the context of the star gate sequence in       released the same year  pure abstraction isn t really my thing  but i can take it in small doses and the super saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers  rohrschach blots  birds  etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful  certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the   s  and deserves to be better known',1

'all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done  it may not be up to par with what everyone expects  but look at it this way  would you expect perfection in hell  it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose  it was great to see her character transformation in this movie  considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get  i hope for a sequel very soon  if we want live action  i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori  i don t think lady death would transfer well to film  but be that as it may  it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong  no pun intended',1

'it s a very good movie  not only for the fans of lady death comics  but also for those who like animated movies series of adventure and fantasy the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn t done  but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell  lucifer himself then she seeks revenge   and the rest you better see it from the movie i liked the movie a lot  the characters are like the original comics  form chaos  i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics  only the last ones  after the passages in the movie  so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics  but   one way or another it s the story of lady death',1

'i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating s some people have given it  it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated  now if you don t like comic books or animation then of course you won t like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me  though  if you are a fan of interesting  strong characters and heroic sexy  women kicking butt and saving the world hell  you will love this movie  i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie  quite anime esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation  like titan a e  meet s the live action version of punisher  in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie',1

'i love the movies and own the comics  the comics are different then the movie but still i d give it     out of     it was awesome  if the movies got anymore awesome  i would have her babies  and i am female  read the comics you won t regret it  yes in this movie since brian p  the artist for her died we don t get nearly as good artistic work  i mean seriously don t get me wrong these people did great  but different versions for different people  different strokes for different folks as the saying goes  any guy who doesn t go bonkers over her is insane  or does not like women  or you know just plan insane  if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure  but hey there is always toes',1

'although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death i have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance the animation was ok  i got the sense of the    s anime from it which is what set it off for me  why everyone else hates that is beyond me character development was fine  i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around  for you who don t like it  obviously wasn t paying attention  lucifer tells you how it happens  and she used his words creamtor was a nice mentor soldier for her  his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie i think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider  cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d',1

'rented this one accidentally  it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting  didn t find out until i got home  watched it anyways  absolutely fantastic  a wonderful movie  and one of my top three favorite of all time  i recommend it to everyone the story is enjoyable and easy to follow  this could have been easily messed up  but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together the actors themselves are fantastic  displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job gotta find a copy somewhere',1

'in my years of attending film festivals  i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution  and they end up in the    bins at walmart  i just found dvd of yank tanks there  great doc  but how sad for it to end up as a rock bottom remainder i loved this film  wish i d seen it at the cinema in it s everything  i d have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly  it s good for americans to stretch a little  if the film s title helps the us audience to explore random chaos  all the better  cinema imitates life   visa versa also  i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars  come on  the euro is not hard to figure out  make the gringo audiences do the math  seeing a film  especially one shot in paris  the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded  i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer   director as well',1

'this film has renewed my interest in french cinema  the story is enchanting  the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful  i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie',1

'stargate sg    follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg   through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole having seen this series sporadically for it s first few seasons when it first came out  i didn t know how good this series would really be     years after i had last seen an episode  my old impression was that the series was great  but my impression was far from the truth   stargate sg    is more than just a simple sci fi series  it is one of the most well made  interesting  long running  exciting sci fi ever produced  and why  because it runs on an amazing premise this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television  as a medium  with a suitable premise  is able to provide something that doesn t work on the time restriction of film  the sense of familiarity created by a long running series  watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief  and it s all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show  stargate sg    kept offering great adventures throughout the    years  but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show   the first few seasons  perhaps up to the  th  th  focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations  keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul d threat   from the  th to the  th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul d and preventing attacks on earth  after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg   in a place of goaul d replicator ori conflicts  the  th season is probably the most mixed one  it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned  but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments   the  th and   th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o neil  they are both good continuations  although the first few episodes of the   th season are a little weak  because they seem to be about little more than sg   and human jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori basically  after season    exploration was pushed to the background  which in many ways was a shame  because of the potential and mystery each planet episode  presented  on the other hand  it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest  the feeling i have is that it could go on  the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer  a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome  but ultimately things are as they are in the end  because of the fact that i enjoyed everything  it s a little hard to find that it ends  the big picture  however  the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of    years  is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew  those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg',1

'this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment   its the best ending of any movie i ve ever seen  perfect  beautiful  funny  simply wonderful i found this movie delightful  even with it s french taking itself too seriously deep meanings thing going on  i loved it   it s a great love story  and i loved the way algerians were woven in   and by the way  the music during the final credits is great  i want the cd',1

'this whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular  amelie   both having the wonderful audrey tautou playing the central role  laurent firode  the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of france in recent memory the film deals with chance  as its english title indicates  the french title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly  as well as hurricanes in the pacific  something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects  from the start  the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other  something that is hard to imagine  but in the film s context seems to work well a chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film  irene  who is going to work  is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper  irene  it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day  after irene leaves the train  the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as irene  it seems they are destined to one another from the start  but alas  they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film audrey tautou is wonderful as irene  faudel  who plays younes  doesn t have a lot to do until the end  but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part  the talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film  which is as light as butterfly wings we look forward to future films by laurent firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected',1

'to me  this review may contain spoilers  but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen  so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers i just watched this movie again  and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie  ever  ever  ever  the real translation   the beating of the butterfly s wings   is oddly not used as the translated title  i suppose they thought most americans wouldn t know what chaos theory is  except for those who saw or read  jurassic park    the movie is based on chaos theory  and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events  which all lead back to one event  the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect  as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters  about       in a way  the ending seems inevitable despite this  but if you think about it  it is a perfect ending  think to yourself   what else needed to be said   it is at the same time a very brave ending  too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one  but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood',1

'most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character   it is not really audrey tautou s real life personality  hence  every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part    part    etc now with that said  i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it  yes  it s true  there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn t seen at all for maybe    min  but i didn t even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters  the guy who lies about everything is too funny  the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss  actually     getting into all the characters here could take quite a while  but this is one of the best movies i ve seen in a while audrey tautou s character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was  in fact  as irene  her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first  in this film  irene is a girl with good intentions  but over the course of a  very awful  day  her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building    very entertaining to watch  great scenery and shots  very colorful and never too slow  and all of the characters can actually act  the best part of the movie comes with about    minutes left     this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense  and the whole butterfly effect blossoms  i swear  it was the best    minutes of film i ve seen in quite a while  and the ending     it made me think  damn i really lucked out finding this movie   the ending to this movie is top notch  whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant  because not only are there all these other subplots going on  but to somehow make them all tie in together  and in a sensible manner  which is the case here  but also to make each character feel human and come alive  not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect    very impressive i highly suggest this movie as it s a great film to watch anytime  in any mood  with any company or alone',1

'the mystery here is why this delightful  small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves  simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations  its rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and  unlike some of its more critically acclaimed competition in the genre  such as the taste of others  it actually entertains',1

'the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific  according to this theory  somehow related to the chaos theory  i m not sure exactly how   every action  no matter how small or insignificant  will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events  this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters  most of them in paris  whose actions will affect each others  lives   the six degrees of separation theory can be applied as well   each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film  the acting is finely tuned and nuanced  audrey tautou is luminous   the stories mesh plausibly  the humor is just right  and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement',1

'we have to remember that the    s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies  hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies  noir  two reel oaters  etc to movies with a message  we had blackboard jungle  on the waterfront and so on  some folks might think that was an improvement  i don t  who was the mogul who said  if you want to send a message  call western union  he was right  these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy this one is a pip  it s about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father s estate  one of them  maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay  he s initially in it for the bucks  but eventually falls for her  meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance  the results are predictable  you get a little bit of everything in this movie  sexual tension between the sisters  a little subtle masochism  hereditary insanity   if there is such a thing  we never get to meet the parents  but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown  one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar  the acting is so bad it s hard to believe  it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel air productions  it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits  the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke  it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene i can t explain it   not even to myself   but i gave this pile of trash an       i m familiar with the term  it s so bad it s good   but i don t think i ever ran into the phenomenon before  well  maybe  hot rods to hell   but this one certainly fits  you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody s basement',1

'being a giant monster fan  me seeing  yeti  was an absolute must  especially after hearing so much about it  thanks to the good  ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily  and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually  dare i say  decent decent for what it is  actually  namely a cheesy giant monster flick  it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately  and we get introduced to various characters  they consist of some sleazy ones  some good ones  and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci fi film  by far yeti looks like a long haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert  and really  he s not that bad of a dude  especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage like thing  godzilla he is not   despite his rude awakening  he doesn t even rampage  actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture   but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out  yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely  my copy was dubbed in english  and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are however  we want to see the giant yeti do his thing  and he s pretty much in the whole movie  and in typical low budget fashion  he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there s even a bunch of the  fake legs  shots of him just standing there yes  the special effects aren t the greatest  but there are definitely some good ones here  a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well  and in another  he uses the windows of a building as  ladder steps  to climb down from the top of it   shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside   in one sequence that really looks much  much better than it should in such a  bad  movie  yeti  never stoops as low as say   a p e   does  actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti s nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an  oh yeah baby  manner  but even this isn t that bad  and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing  but surprisingly enough it doesn t get boring   the story is actually good  and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy  yeti  may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks  but it is definitely better than other king kong     rip offs like  a p e   and  queen kong  by very far',1

'yeti deserves the   star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made  i saw it at a midnight screening in l a  and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity   this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does  the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill fitting suit   the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen   and yes  there is a mute boy  who sorta kinda looks like a girl  and he s mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents  hmmm  maybe therapy for the kid     then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti  once he thaws   which takes forever     and he is instantly in love with her   what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes  bedroom eyes  at her   it s like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie  in fact  once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest   she accidentally touches the yeti s nipple and yes  the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard     yikes of all yikes  plus there s a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie   there s also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish   keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl s hair  gee  thanks yeti   now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout  you re the best   this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up  if you are a fan of classic cinema crap   seek this baby out',1

'people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs  congo  king kong vs  godzilla  king kong         they all ripoff one another  but yeti stands on its own  it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal s attraction with one female the yeti myth is based on bigfoot  not like king kong and archeologists have been fascinated it  at one time they did exist but there is no scientific data to prove it this movie is hard to find  but its worth watching it  the first time i watched it was on  elvira s mistress of the dark shows  in the early      s  it sent chills down my spine as a kid  especially when the yeti got mad  i saw it again  around     am on abc about   to  yrs ago  seeing it again made me appreciate it more  it has some overall good effects  for its time  and the story involves a mute boy and his dog  and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes  also the music is pretty cool its very yeti like     gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere vote   and half out of',1

'here s another movie that should be loaded into a satellite  fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity  this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip off of the already bad movie classic king kong from      that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness  but successfully predicted much of peter jackson s miserable      computer cartoon bearing the same name  as far as a  romance  between the giant  here a yeti  and a gorgeous human female  antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi s city of the living dead  who is very easy on the eyes  the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex    the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package  the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness  but as a trade off you do get a wacky old scientist  two inquisitive kids  tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain  a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure  dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while  and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti  who turns out to be the good guy  glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands  a monster who s size literally changes scale from shot to shot  some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison  crowd reaction shots a plenty made up of either spanish  italian or canadian extras depending upon scene  you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed   and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie it s here that the film won me over  it s enthusiasm just for being made  frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in      and god s gun the year before this   was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action adventure genre film scene from the      s      s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work  i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever  or rather the one he took the most chances with  and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids   families  the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless  or rather they are part of the fun  and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn t have worked    which is exactly why peter jackson s movie sucked he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators  and with all it s faults   clunkiness  kramer s yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this  which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages  not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space  i d rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it  curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever  because the movie looks so  fake  you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked  trampled  tossed about and smashed  knowing that and armed with a fertile  energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie  parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend  this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid        it s about ten minutes too long but who cares  you only come around once and i d rather go out with a smile on my face',1

'having seen most of ringo lam s films  i can say that this is his best film to date  and the most unusual  it s a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick ass martial arts  where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters  the action is fantastic  the story is tense and entertaining  and the set design is truely memorable  sadly  burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next to impossible to get your mitts on  even if you near the second biggest china town in north america  like i do   if you can find it  don t pass it up',1

'burning paradise  is a combination of neo shaw brothers action and ringo lam s urban cynicism  when one watches the film  they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn t matter  it s attitude and atmosphere that counts  this great film has both   always trying to be different than his contemporaries  lam gives us to traditional heroes fong sai yuk and hung shi kwan and puts them in a  raiders of the lost ark  setting  however  these are not the light hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie  instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results  what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime  there is no holding back  too bad  they don t make films like this more often',1

'an unusual film from ringo lam and one that s strangely under appreciated  the mix of fantasy kung fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes  a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse  several horses get chopped up  it s very unexpected the story is very simple  fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple  the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak  blood is everywhere  the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time  sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it s never bad enough to ruin the film find this one  it s one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties  just remember it s not child friendly',1

'hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones  the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers  as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes  where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure  sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood',1

'this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong s  new wave  that began with tsui hark s  zu  warriors of magic mountain   tsui set a tone for the new wave s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave  jackie chan  sammo hung  wong jing  ching siu tung  etc   accepted from then on as a given  namely  the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony  if not outright comedy   burning paradise  put a stop to all that  and with a vengeance it s not that there isn t humor here  but it is a purely human humor  as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw  but this is just as humans are  not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time when irony is at last introduced into the film  it is the nastiest possible  emanating from the  abbot  of red lotus temple  who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before  he is the very incarnation of milton s satan from  paradise lost    better to rule in hell than serve in heaven   and if he can t get to satan s hell soon enough  he ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule that s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here  it s not that the abbot just wants to kill people  he wants them to despair  to feel utterly hopeless  to accept his nihilism as all encompassing reality  thus there s a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself   it has become all there is to the universe  and the abbot  claiming mastery of infinite power  is in charge of course  fortunately  the film doesn t end there  though there are losses  the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails   if you want to know how  see the film   yet there is no doubt that  in viewing this film  we visit hell  hopefully  we do not witness our own afterlives  but we certainly feel chastened by the experience   and somehow better for it over all',1

'people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie  and this movie is no exception  some movies i love did poorly at the box office but  i m glad to say  this movie isn t one of them  over nine million dollars  which i don t think was bad for back then   the characters were fun  the animation was clear and not fuzzy  and the music was modern  too  which is unusual for an animated movie  i didn t think professor screw eyes or his  scary cirus  was too scary for little kids  the targeted audience for this movie   but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids  movie  overall  this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years',1

'i disagree with anyone who done t like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do  it s sweet  funny and warms your heart  and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didn t have much of a story  it was still excellent i give it a    and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish s and dreams can come true   tear  tear i love this movie  personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say  shame on you   because it was a delightful little movie and i m glad that at least some people liked it',1

'this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years  i will sadly miss it  although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit the last ever episode of sg  on television anyway was beautifully done  robert wrote something that felt close to reality  as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show   everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up s and downs  but over the years they ve turned into a family   i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else s criticisms sg  was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement  the wonderful characters  stories  directors  writers  from episode one i was hooked  the blend of action  science  drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me  i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years  it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them  i never want the show to die stargate sg',1

'i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart  but i was flabbergasted when i saw the     rating to one of my childhood favourites  it doesn t wow me as much at     but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie  kids will definitely love it and won t mind the flaws  and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film  none of the film was preachy in any way  in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness  i will admit though that the story is on the thin side  and some scenes like screweyes s death which still freaks me out  may be a tad on the scary side  but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation  the music by james horner is very beautiful  and the song featured is memorable  catchy and amusing  i really liked the characters  louie is probably the most in depth of them all  but the dinosaurs were at least engaging  martin short s clown was both hilarious and emphatic  the part when he tells screweyes  i quit   had me in stitches  my favourite is screweyes though  an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent  if anything though  i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could ve been more developed in terms of depth  the script  while not oscar worthy  has its funny and heart warming parts  and should keep kids and adults entertained  the voice acting for me was what made the movie  john goodman  martin short  rhea perlman  felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances  but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable  all in all  this is a good movie  i don t get the rating  honestly i don t  sure this film isn t perfect  and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time  but it is good fun         bethany cox',1

'i saw this when it first came to video  my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably    at the time    what stood out for me was the lack of mid movie conflict that so many movies have  where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don t say the one thing that you re shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal  that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say  this is what i like the most about the movie i guess  that the main characters don t do mean things to each other halfway through    they don t break up and make up  they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track  they re not that different  loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family  and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone  anyway  i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again    sure there s plot holes if you analyze the script and no  woog and dweeb shouldn t be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality now  what detracts from the film is it s unexpected scariness  little kids under the age of   would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr  screweyes  and  the addition of him halfway through the movie  though it s blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance  is too abrupt    there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie  perhaps to show that it s not that scary without the the dinosaurs  i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie  so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half considering the target audience  who i m sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues    i think i ll give it a pass on those factors too  and just enjoy the story  it s a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind    makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every    years i think',1

'this movie has to be my favorite of all time  its not supposed to have a plot  because its makers wanted people  charlie sheen  i think to believe it was a real snuff film  this was an exercise in visual effects  and doesn t cut away when the action happens like every other film does  movies these days are now all about sound effects  leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood  there still are movie makers who still can t get fake blood to look like the real thing  there is no rape scene because that wasn t the point of making the film  have you seen the hills have eyes    the rape scene was funny instead of shocking  although i m sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror  but since they probably suck at making films  they probably wouldn t be able to pull it off  the movie  baise moi  has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks its too bad that a movie can t be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all  especially when talking about an ao or nc    rating  i m sure eli roth has the ability talent to make his hostel film series much much better  but he has too tame it down to get an r rating   or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage  accident   crime scenes footage   don t forget that this movie was made in       the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film  that would be like someone saying the  bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps  has better graphics',1

'i haven t always been a fan  but the show grew on me  it wasn t until after season   that i started to see the richness of the show  they finally brought daniel jackson s search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go ould system lords were killed by rival lords  sg   or others towards season    stargate sg    was beginning to become stale  with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise  the show became more and more solid the characters had become stale as well  colonel jack o neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage  after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o neill s weapon  he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go ould ra  the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself  only allowing his close friends in amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter  she was a feminist on the edge  ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job  though this character had little area to grow  tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter s strengths  she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal c  teal c was an alien called the jaffa  infant go ould   snake like creatures  would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form  the jaffa would die  teal c was the first prime of apophis  army  knowing that apophis was not a god like go ould pretend  he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy  finally  having had enough  he and jack o neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people  after arriving on earth  he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for  who would help him fight the go ould  christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character  teal c is a wise warrior  much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra tac  the show would not be complete without master bra tac played by tony amandola  he is also a rock  in the end  he became adviser to most of sg    especially daniel jackson don s  davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand  davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal  he does his job  has a wife  sons and daughters and grandchildren  you can really say  he is the anchor of the base  simply  i would die for that man  if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world  he will go himself  he doesn t leave anyone behind i saved dr  daniel jackson for last  because this character  i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on  in choosing shanks i don t think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson  they don t talk about spader  they talk about shanks  in the early years  the jackson character came off as a whiner  that s why i probably wasn t a fan  as the seasons pasted  the character became stronger  this gave him confidence  in the end  as of season     the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero  he still monitors the groups ethics  he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward  acheaology  history  culture and exploration are part of his very being  he is determined  though a man of peace  he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement other characters include  most recently  vala mal doran claudia black  and colonel cameron mitchell ben browder   new lead of sg    both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess  i see little difference between mitchell and crichton  farscape character   black s character is simply off the wall  definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon',1

'after having watched  guinea pig   two questions come in mind   besides  am i really a psychopath to watch that         is it a snuff    the answer is no   although it s the closest thing to a snuff movie i ve ever seen  and then    where the hell have they found that girl     because she gets tortured for     min  without any reasons given   in fact  there is nothing else in this movie      fingernails teared off  beaten with hands  feet  tools  infested by maggots      and many more until the final scene   i m still not sure how they did that    because it belongs to the  japonese underground scene   it s obvious she didn t get a lot of money  so what were her   their   motivations  i saw it in japonese without subtitles  but it s not a problem   no real dialogues  the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes    i haven t seen yet all the serial  but the first  guinea pig  is not known for being the best one  still i ve rated    because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff  the issue is quite good   ask charlie sheen  the actor    but i think they could have gone further  which they did in the following ones another movie i m hiding from my parents',1

'i have seen the short movie a few years ago  after that i watch all sequels  the first one is really not the best   but it s the most popular one  i ve already watch the making of guinea pig    it s really great what these guys did  also the sequels are excellent in the special effects  take your chance to watch it',1

'this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best  at the same time  it looks realistic and unrealistic  just knowing that the movie is fake  the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways  a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address  and it includes a manga video  showing the torture  the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die  some scenes are shocking  such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched     times  because you see punches in nearly every movie  this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people    or older',1

'the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape  complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame  it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her  the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers  her hand smashed with a hammer  her eye punctured with a needle  and so forth in the most nauseating scene  the woman s captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns  the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen  believing the series to contain actual murder  attempted to ban its distribution in the united states  an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers    sick re creations using nasty  but obvious special effects  gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic book artist hideshi hino  who also directed the third and fourth episodes  this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms  but  gorehounds probably won t find anything special',1

'what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said  well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks  how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know  im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was  however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real  and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me',1

'wow  alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here  wonderful  my name is steve and i run unearthed films  we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america  now before you ask why am i writing a review  instead ask why some people bash it  i m writing this review because i love the guinea pig films  why do i love em  it s because they go for the throat and they don t let go  i ve seen it all  almost every horror film known to man  argento  fulci  bava  buttgereit  from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster  i ve seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films  why because it doesn t try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the  st place  this review is for the devils experiment  i find it devoid of story which is fine by me  why do i watch horror films  so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people  the devils experiment not only delivers but that s all it is  pure unadulterated violence  yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold  why do people bash it  cause they like a story  so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story  it make em feel better about themselves  we all want blood and gore  it s just really hard to justify it if it s not wrapped around a story  the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released i m thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world  maybe i shouldn t have written this review but then again maybe i should  my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it s not  i ve always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films  sure it s exploitive and over the top but isn t that why we watch horror films in the  st place  the devils experiment is not for everybody  it s for thrill seekers and gorehounds only  if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those  but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you  there is a reason why they haven t been released for over    years  they are wrong  disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom  unless she is totally cool  good luck  enjoy and never stop living your life',1

'a lot of people unfairly sh t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining  devil s experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work  not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic  especially for the video s vintage and low budget let me start at the beginning now for those who don t know  this film is an  extreme  torture fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid   s  it s plot as it stands is simple  a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is  this entails brutal violence  all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl s arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground  these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings the actress who plays the victim of the  experiment  is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera  her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling  some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest  also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes if you haven t seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot         for devil s experiment',1

'my rating refers to the first   seasons of stargate sg   which are wonderfully fresh  creative and addicting  when the cast stepped through the gate  you never knew what lay on the other side  starting around season    the show took a different focus   still good  but different the series follows the adventures of a team of humans  and one alien  who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the  stargate   the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie  stargate  in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt the episodes are light  innocent and easy to watch  and very creative  many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci fi movies of their own  what happens next was always unpredictable the characters on which the show rests are also well defined and brilliantly performed  their tone is serious  but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor  they are simply fun to watch starting somewhere around season    the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe  the goa uld  then the ori   the plots become more complex  a lot more political strategic oriented  and interdependent  the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the    th and    th episodes  they are simply can t miss shows  they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through    seasons if you are a sci fi fan  watch a few episodes of the first   seasons and you ll likely be hooked  if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides  you have    seasons of shows to look forward to',1

'the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her she is beaten savagely spun around in the chair endlessly has her finger nails pulled animal guts are thrown at her hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle really sick and nasty scene  the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome i have seen also  flowers of flesh and blood  which is more gory and sadistic but less disturbing anyway this one is a must see for horror fans',1

'first off  this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to  the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema  apparently its the other way around  if one were to look back after the film it really wasn t meant to be convincing  it was a low budget ipecac  but really thats all it was aiming for  it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value  and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions  i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific  in non shock sense  it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid pessimistic i didn t trust anyone for about a week because i didn t want to wake up strung up and tortured',1

'just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion  every line  every phrase  every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con man  so well cast     out of',1

'house of games  is a flawlessly constructed film  and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends  i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert s review  which proclaimed it the best film of       i had my doubts  mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year  boy  was i in for a surprise  this was one of the smartest  most well written movies i had ever seen the screenplay is quite a piece of work  not only in terms of the plot  which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out   but also in terms of character development  on my second viewing  i began to realize that mamet s screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film  but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations  the climax of the movie is particularly effective  because it is absolutely inevitable  it stems naturally from what we know about the characters  and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending  the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film  i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike  and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset  their work  plus mamet s extraordinary screenplay  combine to create one of the greatest films of the      s  it is truly a must see',1

'just watched the film for the  rd time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before  it just keeps getting better and better  you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech  the slow deliberate action  everything being exactly in place truly one of the great ones and definitely my all time favourite',1

'unique movie about confused woman  lindsay crouse  who gets involved with sharp con men  joe mantegna gives an oscar caliber performance as the slickest of the group  absolutely enchanting first hour  as mantegna shows crouse  the ropes  of his con games  story line unravels a bit later on  but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world  definitely worth a shot',1

'house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part  a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong  watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way  sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators  you re never sure of who is exactly who in this movie this is both a quality and a drawback of the script  as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency  but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling',1

'plenty has been written about mamet s  the house of games   most of it good  i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after    years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again  the film s success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film  a good story and a good scam  mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us  the audience  and the mark simultaneously  then he explains the art of conning only to do it again  etc  all the while building the story   the house of games   now a freebie on cable  is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans   b',1

'this typical mamet film delivers a quiet  evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man  joe mantegna  good  explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist  lindsay crouse   it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences  the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamet s films  steven goldstein  jack wallace  ricky jay  andy potok  allen soule  william h  macy   and they do their usual good job  i loved lindsay crouse in this film  and have often wondered why she didn t become a more noted player than she has become  perhaps i m not looking in the right places the movie proceeds at a slow pace  with flat dialog  yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang up ending  you d expect a real let down at the ending  but i found it uplifting and satisfying  i love this movie',1

'i enjoyed this show for two reasons    richard dean anderson    amanda tapping  these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors  the replacement of rda in seasons      was enough to take the heart out of the show the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous  you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling  this relationship carries over into the program we get to see rda gives his  o neill  character believable personality  he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest  you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances  still  they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous there is a lot going on between  carter  and  o neill  under the surface  they manage to keep the lid on  but often just barely  the episode  solitudes  in season   had some of the best drama ever seen on television  the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together  carter  and  jackson  often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by  o neill   yet  o neill s  tactical instincts always seem sound  he understands what to do without having to think about the matter  the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders the quality declined markedly in seasons   and     the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest  ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show  he had his rare moments with claudia black  but that was all  amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons  you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby  she was probably thinking more about the child than the show the spin off  stargate atlantis  has a few moments  but is mostly a weaker effort  the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original  the villains  wraiths  are so improbable as to be ludicrous  maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won t last beyond the fourth season there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show  to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci fi  the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad  the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra modern technology is just as hard to accept i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too  in the season   opener   daniel jackson  is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded  he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet  the episode  hathor  has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc  yet it is never mentioned again  this device could have been used in several later episodes on  daniel    o neill   and  dr  frasier',1

'a film destined to be on late night tv long after the present instant  money makers  have long been forgotten  perhaps a little too subtle for today s youngsters  but in time they ll grow into an appreciation of this movie',1

'this movie should not be compared to  the sting   or other caper heist con game films  what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships  deceit and trust  it s also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry  given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale  has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy  highly  hugely recommended',1

'ask yourself where she got the gun  remember what she was taught about the mark s mindset when the con is over  the gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning when the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her    thousand the patient was in on the con from the beginning mantegna does not die in the end   the gun had blanks there   enough spoilers for you there  this is why people are giving it such high ratings  it s extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience',1

'i m a big fan of films where people get conned  and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the  films where people get conned  genre  in short  it s an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels  and never truly revealing what s happening  while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you ve just seen  the film cons the audience on many occasions  and despite us knowing this  it s still difficult to guess where it s going  and every twist comes off as a surprise  as mentioned  i m a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler  she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient  and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout  and david mamet does well in establishing his film s setting in the underground levels of the city  the film is well acted also  with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill  joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film  and although his performance is a little under wrought  he s always solid and believable as the villain of the piece  lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work  and again is believable in her role  she may not be the greatest looker  but at least she can act  the way that the film executes it s plot is the main star of the show  however  and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer  at times it s almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film  another thing that s great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons  which is useful if you re interested in making twenty bucks  say  all in all  house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride',1

'spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters  but who is conning who here  when does the hunter turn into the prey  this gritty  dark movie is slow moving and seductive  it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path  only to waylay you just as you think you are safe it has a riveting script  with good acting  at least from the leads   i didn t notice the background music  but it was never jarring  so it must have been done right i was very surprised that i liked this movie  because i don t usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end',1

'get ready for it  this is one of my favourite films of all time  i am relatively unaware of david mamet s  writer and director  other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times it s always a joy to watch   i can say without hesitation that he is a genius  this film is extremely well written  and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit  con artistry and back room hustles  the feel of the film is very similar to the sting        and it also pays homage to film noir it s quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters  it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch generally  the acting is superb  especially joe mantegna  but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it s not a good idea to have a heroine  lindsay crouse  who is not only a gambler  a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad    s hairdo  i agree  but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role the less you know about the plot of this film  the better  just like mamet s most recent film  the spanish prisoner  because the ending will be even more impressive  just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance',1

'opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama  all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener  and the performer  intrigued and entertained applies to this film  there isn t a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad  mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor  if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended  as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited',1

'this is very nearly a perfect film  the ideas would be repeated by mamet  but never told so succinctly  this is really about the failure of trust  of the human condition  the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals  no one is innocent  is there anyone alive today who hasn t seen this play out in our own society  every single day  the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller  except  there are no more innocent characters  the world is now completely polluted  ruined and everyone is participating in the con  could anything be more true don t miss the soundtrack  it is wonderful',1

'wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it s hopeless to help her patients  a young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better  here she gets involved with joe mantegna  to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and  house of games  may very well be the best con movie i ve seen  david mamet wrote and directed this gem that s full of snappy dialogue  great one liners  and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end  crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con man  and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie  the film is in utter control of it s audience  and we are loving the con     out of',1

'i m not great at writing reviews  so i ll just spout my opinions   i loved this series at first  the adventure  the action  the comedy  the drama    i thought it was all brilliant  anderson  tapping  shanks  judge  davis    i loved them all  davis  it seemed  was the fifth most important person in the cast  not a big deal  but when his character  general hammond  left at the end of the seventh season  and anderson s character  colonel o neill  moved from the field to the office  the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff  i don t know whether it s because hammond was more important that i realized or what  but for some reason  after the seventh season  the series turned to      the first seven seasons  though  were awesome  the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it  but it turned out to be  even if this wasn t the original intention  a brilliant setup to the series  i recommend that you watch the movie first  then watch the first season of the tv series  then watch the movie again  you ll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around  believe me   and then watch the rest of the tv series the last three seasons of the series aren t nearly as good as the first seven  but that doesn t mean they aren t good  it just means they re a letdown if you ve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons after you have finished this series  be sure to watch the spin off series  stargate  atlantis  it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series edit on          i just found out that don s  davis died a few weeks ago  it is a great loss',1

'house of games is spell binding  it s so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens  there are few movies i ve seen that can grip you so quickly  from the opening scene this movie just gets you i m trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don t read anymore if you don t want to know i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen bar none  from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection  from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately  joe mantegna was also wonderful  the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices  i also loved the way the movie was filmed  in that grainy  surreal type of way  it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was there were a few movies i ve seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really  house of games is completely different in it s way  margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i ve seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet  but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying  you know something s going to happen but you have no idea what  and just when you think you ve guessed what the  something  is  you realize you haven t even scratched the surface    house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature  the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well  as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters  we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it  it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it s conclusion in closing  i d rank this    of     call it  although not my absolute favorite film  pretty high on the list   most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best  twists  i ve ever seen as well  although i love all types and genres of movies  when it comes to movies of the human psyche  it really doesn t get much better then this  see this movie',1

'if your idea of a thriller is car chases  explosions  and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire  then  house of games  is definitely not the movie for you  if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense  then  by all means  see it  house of games  tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer  dr  margaret ford  lindsay crouse   who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike  joe mantegna   to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense  frankly  i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming  just like a clever con artist  this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance the story is taut and well crafted  the dialogue smart and laconic  the acting uniformly good  mantegna is superbly charismatic   some have complained that dr  ford is not a very sympathetic character  and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive  but dr  ford is supposed to be cold and aloof  moreover  her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot  at one point  i believe that an injury to her sexual self esteem is a key part of her motivation     i ll say no more   house of games  is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity  it will hold your attention every second while you are watching  and stay with you for a long time afterwards',1

'house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels  it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller  it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay crouse and joe montegna  and a strong  strong cast of supporting players  and it introduces ricky jay  card sharp extraordinaire  prestidigitator and historian of magic  its dialogue  written by david mamet  is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie  in which reality is often in question  an extra dimension of unrealness on the face of it  house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men  diametrically different from the sting  which was played merely for glamour and yuks  at this level it does succeed admirably however  you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization  the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin  that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus  hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs  house of games sticks to its business  as poe once said of a good short story  it drives relentlessly to its conclusion there is another strain of movies about women  epitomized by thelma and louise  a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed  whether or not they realize their inner strengths  what tripe as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater  it should be a natural for film festivals  nominate it for one near you if you get the chance i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my    year old daughter  better she should see it on a tv than not at all',1

'the united states of kiss my ass house of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller  it stars lindsay crouse as best selling psychiatrist  margaret ford  who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide  in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels  downtown  to visit the lowlife place  house of games the gambler mike  played excellently by joe mantegna  turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty  he offers crouse s character a deal  if she is willing to sit with him at a game  a big money game in the backroom  he ll cancel the patients debts  the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work  gaining the trust of others  and a fascinating relationship begins  what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control  is it the psychiatrist or the con man or is it the well known man of great bluffs david mamet in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring  however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings  not the direction  in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads  showy and distracting  but mainly as is the case with much of mamet s work  it is the dialogue  which grips you and slowly draws you into the film  no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words  everyone bluffs and double bluffs  which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order  this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension  house of games can also be viewed as a  class war  division movie  with lindsay crouse we have the middle class  well to do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite  the working class of america earning a living by  honest  crime the film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema  and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for  it s stunning an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings',1

'david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with  house of games   a character study fraught with psychological overtones  in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game  margaret ford  lindsay crouse  has a successful practice and has written a best selling novel   driven   still  she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life  there s an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve  and it primes her vulnerability  when a patient  billy hahn  steven goldstein   confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers  and that they re going to kill him if he doesn t pay  she decides to intervene on his behalf  this takes her to the  house of games   a seedy little dive where she meets mike  joe mantegna   a charismatic con man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world  instead of the  twenty five large  that billy claimed he owed  mike shows her his book  and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars  and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean  if she ll agree to do him one simple favor  which involves a card game he has going on in the back room  in the middle of a big hand  mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes  while he is gone  her job is to watch for the  tell  of one of the other players  by this time  not only margaret  but the audience  as well  is hooked  the dialogue  and mamet s unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines  is mesmerizing  as mike leads margaret through his compelling  surreal realm of existence  and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game  we are swept right along with her  from that first memorable encounter  when he demonstrates what a  tell  is and how it works  to the lessons of the  short con   to the stunning climax of this film  mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless  and nothing is what it seems  in the end  margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature  and about herself  she changes  and whether or not it s for the better is open to speculation  mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film  he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows  and does  crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here  you feel the rigid  up tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm  self assured exterior  and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her  she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated  she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does  and makes you understand it  as well  the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum  joey   lilia skala  dr  littauer   j t  walsh  the businessman   ricky jay  george  and william h  macy  sergeant moran    house of games  is the quintessential mamet  he s written and directed a number of high caliber plays and films since  and will no doubt grace us with more in the future  but this film will be the one that defines him  and you can go to the dictionary and look it up  you ll find it under  perfection   this is one great movie you do not want to miss  i rate this one',1

'this movie is amazing  while being funny and entertaining  it is also profoundly deep and eye opening  i will watch it again and again  bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life  he has a job and a life  but it isn t what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness  bruce is bitter  unsatisfied  and resentful that his life isn t the way he envisions it should be  as a result of this state of mind  bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life  god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers  bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted  his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy     with one exception  in the process of gaining everything  he loses the one person who truly loved him  as the movie unfolds  bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances  but his perception of what was truly there  this movie was inspirational and deep  if you really pay attention  it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize  as my wife says   since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy   and my humble addition   may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out',1

'this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for  if you watch t v   then you might as well not watch the movie  almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews  except one which just happens to be jennifer annisten being the funny one  it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny  just don t go see this movie expecting to be surprised  all in all  if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must see  otherwise just watch the previews and you ll be just as satisfied',1

'i absolutely loved this movie  it met all expectations and went beyond that  i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn t just randomly silly  it also had a message  jim carrey makes me happy',1

'wow  finally jim carrey has returned from the died  this movie had me laughing and crying  it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from  jeniffer aniston was great  she will finally have a hit movie under her belt  if you liked liar liar you will love this movie  i give it',1

'i have to say  from the beginning  when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn t blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie  with a lot of potential  though the movie wasn t as  erm  amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens  which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing  even though i m not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people  i don t remember one line from either of those movies  i m not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts  in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you  ah getting slightly off the point here  well my point is that the that you don t have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series  which unfortunately ended after    amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end  in      though i didn t like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in       and let me tell you  the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series  the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects  were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today  i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn t for stargate  and my dad  who actually got me into sci fi when i was like    and i m glad he did  other wise i wouldn t have seen the brilliant shows like sg   which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies  basically if a new sci fi series isn t better or as good as sg   its not worth watching  basically this is the best sci fi show to date  and if you don t watch this  then you have no idea what you are missing',1

'bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show  and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent  hey hollywood   look how good i can act   box office disappointments  it s great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths  he won t get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the  awarded films  of the academy  he is at the top of his form in this most recent film   it s like the return of an old friend carrey  freeman  and aniston all do a great job together   comfortable in their comedy roles  superb comic timing  and obviously having fun together but without the  hey mom   look how funny i am  type of comedy  a real surprise was steven carrell as carrey s nemesis  carrell of the daily show fame   who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film  i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be up in arms over the treatment of god  but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs   we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will  without married with children t o complain about  this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities  who know the types   men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television  selling prayers to god   and  again  about      of the country will care and     of the media will report it the bottom line  this a purely entertaining film  each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do  and a feel good feeling at the movie conclusion  a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor  what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry thanks again  jim    it s great to have you back',1

'bruce almighty  will sweep the academy awards with a record    oscar wins  it will surpass  titanic  as the highest grossing film of all time  jim carrey s illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the      white house playoffs  almighty then  these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers  carrey included  would possess the powers of god  that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey s new laugh riot  bruce almighty   carrey plays bruce nolan  a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps  god  heavenly played by morgan freeman  grants bruce the  gift of god  his powers  in order to challenge him if he can do god s job any better  obviously  bruce gets  carreyed  away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly  carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in  bruce almighty   jennifer aniston was not  mis pittiful  as bruce s girlfriend  however  my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for     and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time   bruce almighty  is not the most in depth carrey film  but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of  carreyism        good',1

'jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this      season  late may  and a good improvement on carrey s past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies  with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self  carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic  tearfully somber moments  elements of jim s real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie  this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons  including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script  while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy drama  bruce  almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good natured taste  eight out of ten stars',1

'fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc  carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time  and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting  the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast  including morgan freeman as  god   is great and makes the film worth catching  grade  b',1

'well not actually  this movie is very entertaining though  went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the  i think there might be something in my eye  routine  the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance  jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides  in fact all the characters are great  the movie is not overly funny or sappy  good flick to go see with the wife all in all         note   i am not an easy grader  thats all from bigv over and out',1

'i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn t the goal  his character is like all of us  wanting more   better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver morgan freeman made a great god  with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself i thought jennifer aniston s character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry s basically self centered tv anchorman wanna be but that s the way it was written i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep  this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart a funny film',1

'i am a very big jim carrey fan  i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura  i also like him in his serious movies  especially truman show  this one is a cross between his very funny side  and his serious side  he is of course very funny in this movie  but there are parts that are very serious  and he pulls it off with a lot of ease  he is truely a multi function actor as for the rest of the cast  i was happy with jennifer aniston s acting  i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass  morgan freeman makes a very cool god  as for steven carell  his limited scenes are very funny  especially in the anchor scene overall  i would have to rate this a    good acting  funny script  and some very serious situations make this a very good film',1

'i would have rated the series a perfect    for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season    the final episode of the   th season  unending   where  it would certainly appear that  the asgard have been killed off in a very rushed  unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion  left me in disbelief from the extremely rushed end of the series  it s obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season  my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg   franchise for the two upcoming direct to dvd moves unless the asgard return in a future sg   movie  with a very good explanation of the  apparent  extinction   i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean up of loose ends poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci fi series',1

'i first heard about this film about    years ago when i was a kid in grade school     it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day  and under the entry for movies  or cinema  i don t remember   were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental  and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon  it really intrigued me  since it stood out the most on the page  it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it  about    or so years later  the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole   dvd set of  treasures of american film archives  released by the national film preservation foundation  so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set  i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs  after all these years  i could finally see the film  after viewing it  it slightly wasn t was i was expecting it to be  it tended to be a more organic looking film  not that that s a bad thing  but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic   but it was still an impressive film  imho  considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film  including hand tinting the film itself  and using video equipment for some of the film s scenes  filmed off of a video monitor   giving it a more distressed  lo res look don t get me wrong  the techniques used in this film were quite ground breaking for       that s why it s still one of my favorite short experimental films  and a creative inspiration for me as well',1

'a very funny movie  it was good to see jim carrey back in top form  it was definitely worth the price of admission  morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film  i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however  still a good film to see',1

'bruce almighty  one of carrey s best pictures since    well    a long time  it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too    morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny  it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes  the best scene in  it is where jim is messing up the anchor man s voice my rating',1

'this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made  carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film  he was both funny and sad  carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan  nolan blames god morgan freeman  for everything that goes wrong in his life  then  god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers  as i said before  carrey did an excellent job  i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actor actress  the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point  this movie can be funny bruce s dog  as well as sad the  break up    the script worked well  too  i am glad they made a sequel to this film  i rate this film a',1

'if you want a serious laugh pain  watch this movie  and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster  the deleted scenes are priceless  i don t know why they didn t include them in the original movie  it can t be because of time  since the movie is only     minutes long  morgan freeman is a brilliant actor  who has been overlooked for too long  jim carrey needs meds',1

'as someone who lives near buffalo  new york  this movie scored points with me before i even saw it  since the story is based here  there are even some bit parts with real life news tv anchor people from buffalo  and  for once  it doesn t knock the area  hallelujah theology wise  puh leeze    god is still made to look and think like humans   and  of course  be a bit on the liberal side  being the lightweight comedy it is  it s nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill     minutes there are some laugh out loud slapstick comedy scenes and  hopefully  audiences   from christians to atheists   got something out of this besides a few laughs  such as what prayer should really be all about  kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message overall  it s a good hearted film that should offend very few',1

'i really do not know what people have against this film  but it s definitely one of my favourites  it s not preachy  it s not anchored by it s moral  it shouldn t be controversial  it s just god  any possible god  no matter the religion  and it s really funny jim carry plays bruce nolan  a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news  desperate to prove himself  more or less to himself  that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job  this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace  jennifer aniston  away  when the final straws are executed  he s quick to not laugh  but yell in the face of god  who in turn gives bruce his powers  bruce then makes his life better for himself  until he s guilted into helping others  where he then continues to miss the point of his powers  meanwhile  his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish  leaving his relationship on dangerous ground ok  that was kinda long  but as a plot  it works well  the step by step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together  and is able to hide itself fairly well as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place  carrey s pitch perfect acting stays in character  which  luckily enough  is him   and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene  whether they would admit it or not  the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey  without him  the humour would turn flat  as humour is half execution  and the humour is very good in the first place  but without carrey  it would kinda feel like a it s a wonderful life wannabe jennifer aniston is great and  no matter what some may say  does not act like the only excuse for the third act  at least  you don t think that when you see her  she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you re watching a movie  she and carrey feel very much like a real couple the movie feels ggooooodd  see the movie to understand   has a very nice feeling  tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey s career  which wasn t goin  anywhere',1

'well  was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns  this film sure was better than that bore   oh  god   i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through  carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe  and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance  i  for one  don t consider her to be either ugly or untalented  i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history  see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor  i was rolling over this one  well written and even better played out  this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman s best',1

'i nominate this and babylon   as the best television sci fi series made  both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series  there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters  if you look at the original star trek and star trek tng  they were fine shows  but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes  in many ways  you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring  this was less the case with deep space    with its giant battles that took up all of the final season  and the other trek shows  as there was more of a larger story that unified them  this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon   and saw this to an even greater extent with sg    the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form  sure  there were a few  throwaway  episodes that were not connected to the rest  but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny and speaking of funny  i loved that sg   kept the mood light from time to time and wasn t so dreadfully serious  in this way  i actually enjoyed it more than babylon    jack o neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson  it s really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons to truly appreciate sg    you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work  this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power  and  if you don t like sg   after giving it a fair chance  then sci fi is probably not the genre for you',1

'starring  jim carrey  morgan freeman  jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie  i mean  what a conceptual nightmare  jim carrey playing god  nothing is sacred anymore well  this movie is hardly sacred  but it also is not sacrilegious  at least not to any great extent  yes  jim carrey has the powers of god for a while  but he is not god  confused  i ll give you the low down jim carrey plays bruce nolan  a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life  he lives with his beautiful girlfriend  grace  anniston   and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other  but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground then bruce gets a shot at anchorman  only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter  obviously not please  bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired much complaining and griping about god later  bruce gets a page  after a while he gets tired of it calling  so he responds and goes to the omni presents building  heh   there he meets god  freeman   who is the boss  electrician  and janitor of the building  i found this highly amusing  god is the boss  the holy spirit is the electrician  and jesus christ is the janitor  think about it  boss  obvious  electrician  the guy who keeps everything running  janitor  the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left  brilliant anyway  bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god  but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god  he starts to believe a bit  wonder why  enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies since this is hollywood  bruce obviously eventually smartens up  learns his lesson  and starts using his powers for the good of the world  in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done  not bruce s since it is jim carrey  the movie is quite amusing  and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it  the movie is not perfect theology  but for hollywood  it is definitely a good attempt  many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging  and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie so  while far from perfect  definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it bottom line      out of    worth a view or two',1

'jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask  a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck  even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums  and of course they have to be mexican  obviously   his good will towards his fellow man backfires  in that case  it wasn t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums  but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn t be ignored  i m reminded of the episode of michael moore s brilliant the awful truth  when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay  the results were not very promising  so it s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan  the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart  or even better  it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere  a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film   bruce is nearly    years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that s seeking to bake the world s biggest cookie  he s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station  but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague  you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report  needless to say  he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself  displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman s massive talent as an actor  he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously  but in such a way as to advise his followers  as well as the viewers of this movie  that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life  i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day  there are a lot of people in the world  maybe more than our share in america  who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives  and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer s religion  i  for example  tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live  but despite the fact that i don t believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time  i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie jim carrey s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he s come  if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura  both of which i loved  by the way  or a lot of what he did before he got into film  it s amazing how far he s come  he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show  man on the moon  and the majestic  easily one of his greatest films ever   jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie  as she did in the side splitting office space  as bruce s girlfriend  who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him  there is definitely some low brow comedy in the film that doesn t really fit with the importance of the film s meaning or the quality of the delivery  such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene  but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura s friend spike make a cameo appearance  as stephen king very well knows  it s always nice to see familiar characters  it s almost like seeing family again bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better  and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him  the thing i love about this is that  like i said before  religion is absent from my life  but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers  the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way  which empowers the message even more the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film  such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position  the jimmy hoffa scene  who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records   the scene where bruce s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera  and my favorites  the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery s cooking  the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes  such as when he says to god  who reveals that he s the janitor  the proprietor  the electrician  etc  that his christmas parties must be real bashes  and to be careful about drinking  because on of him might need a ride home  i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes  a little too true  and as gallagher would add  behind every great man is also an amazed mother in law bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while  and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection  it is a comedy written and performed in good taste  but with enough relatively low brow humor to keep the kids entertained  this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family  which is becoming rarer and rarer these days  in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie  which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy   it s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching  don t miss this one',1

'as long as you go into this movie knowing that it s terrible  bad acting  bad  effects   bad story  bad    everything  then you ll love it  this is one of my favorite  goof on  movies  watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs',1

'this one and  her pilgrim soul  are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone  as i mentioned in my comment on the new series  there s something lacking in this new series  maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned  it s a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling s version  however  this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too  i think the appeal is that no matter what they do  the lovers can never unite  i remember i wasn t surprised by the korean movie  il mare   later remade into  the lake house   i think it s because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film',1

'this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories  i note both of them are based on short stories    examination day  is set in the future  year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves  huge tv looking  phones  that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age   and the examination day  a point where    year olds must undergo a government required iq test  the kid is this story  dickie jordan  david mendenhall  is just celebrating his own   th birthday and is a smart kid  so is calm  even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades  his parents  christopher allport and elizabeth norment   on the other hand  say he shouldn t have used his birthday wish on getting a good score  and while their reason includes that they believe he s capable and he should have no need to worry  it s pretty obvious they are worried  i won t give anything away in the ending  but i will say this   there s a point where we get a glimpse of what s to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject  that evening  or another   his parents ask dickie whether he d prefer to watch tv all night  by today s standards  we d be pleased he d say he d rather read and not just because there s nothing worth watching   but why would his family ask this  the flavor of what s encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon  which i hear hasn t received a great adaptation to the screen   i only wish they could ve provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was  i found it to be better than the short story it was based on  i haven t read the one that  a message from charity  was based on  but would like to since it was interesting   a    year ld boy  peter  robert duncan mcneill  is suffering a fever from unclean water  that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown   but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever  charity payne   kerry noonann  who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him  they both recover  especially since it s common for that to happen in       but the connection doesn t go away  charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of      and they each enjoy each other s company  especially peter  who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students  even at the college he s been staying in one place at  things take an unexpected turn  though  when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the    colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment  added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever  not so common in        the two try to learn a way to save her  the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching  both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times  through a lesson warning that sounds like something rod sterling would ve cooked up and entertainment  make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship  love  and wisdom do a great deal  probably     of this has no theme  but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling s crew',1

'remember these two stories fondly and in the first  set in the not too distant future  we see a young boy preparing for examination day  the state i q test  the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test  upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why  the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth  the boy then asks  puzzled again  why wouldn t he  it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry  but their son s i q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial  a corker of a concluding scene  a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present  which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present  a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion',1

'this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate  it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention  such as  how was the stargate activated without a human computer  where did the goa uld  ra s race  come from  how many are there the first episode has a retired jack o neill  spelled with   ls  recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis  a powerful goa uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman  we meet samantha carter  a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time  and is determined to go through now  we find out that daniel got married on abydos  and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial  then daniel s wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams  in which jack s team will be sg   which consists of jack  samantha and daniel  they go to chulak  a goa uld homeworld to rescue daniel s wife and another one captured at abydos named ska ra  they get captured  and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners  a jaffa named teal c  first prime of apophis  saves them and goes to earth with them  where he is made part of sg   that was only the beginning of the adventure  in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future  gotten transported to alternate realities  swapped bodies  grown old  met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goa uld called the tok ra  in which samantha s dad becomes a member  the asgard  a cute little race in which we see thor most often  he s jack s buddy  and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times the show was recently canceled  but lasted ten seasons  in season nine  a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers  new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators  the ancients  season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters  ben browder as cameron mitchell  the new leader of sg   and claudia black as vala maldoran  a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team very well produced  interesting characters  fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack  this one has it all  a different way of travelling the galaxy  and different kinds of adventures  this is one show you don t want to miss  unlock the gate and step through  you won t regret it',1

'most people miss hollywood s point of concept  if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child  within the confines of the law then i  approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage in all times of conflict or war  the public and government look for heroes to decorate  the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with   such as doc savage  james bond  superman  batman  spiderman and others  doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the  best of the best  before james bond  superman or any of the others  all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character  not the  man of bronze',1

'this is a very entertaining movie  a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who  apparently  think that the film was an effort at serious drama  it was not made that way    it is an extremely enjoyable film  performed in a tongue in cheek manner  all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us  the fight sequences are lively  brisk and  above all  not gratuitous  the so called  green death   utilized on a couple of occasions  is not  as i read in one review   gruesome   a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film  hey  lighten up    again  i remind one and all that this is a fun film  each phase of this  fight  was captioned  which added to the fun aspect  the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan  this is not one of those martial arts films  ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc  another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the  bad guy   seas  is dealt with  i promise you that if you don t try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value  you will spend     minutes in a most enjoyable manner',1

'outragously entertaining period piece set in the   s  it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series  as much as  raiders of the lost ark   only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson  the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau  predating batman by two decades  starring ron ely  tarzan  as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non existent latin american country of hidalgo  best line  our hero to mona  holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug   mona  you re a brick  paul wexler s ham and cheese blackhat  captain seas is a an absolute delight  expect a little  raiders     a dash of  batman   a little  the lost world   a little  lost horizons  and a whole lot of campiness and you ll get it just right  watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa s patriotic music  a prime candidate for dvd release  it is certainly overdue  an unmissable treat for the whole family',1

'i was brought up on doc savage and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now  i found it thoroughly entertaining i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions granted they mostly think i m odd but there you are   i don t know what it is about the doc  but he always gets the girls  has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men  this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre and was way before it s time it is not to be taken seriously  move over austin powers  ron ely is a god it is unfortunate that this film hasn t been released on dvd in the uk  i don t think it should be remade and bastardised  like i said it s a classic it cannot be done without ron  like the italian job without mini s and michael caine   i give it',1

'we so often talk of cinema landmarks   kane  the godfather  a bout de souffle  one film however is too often overlooked by  serious  film critics  i am talking of course about the classic doc savage  m o b  this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism  not to mention kung fu it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history  until of course queen s breathtaking work on flash gordon   although a bit of a rarity  this film is well worth seeking out   it will repay the effort of your search ten fold',1

'the makers have chosen the best people for the job  and set the scene wonderfully  every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it  whether the period is the   s  the first story   the present  ie       for the middle story  or the     s  the last   costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created  i love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium   exquisite lace overlaid by the finest shetland shawls  roland culver as ashenden is very appealing  but never mind the soppy young lovers  it s raymond huntley as the man who resents his wife s health and independence who harrows our emotions  he usually played comical  pompous types  but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive  the china seas  great   s film starring gable and harlow  stole the plot from the mr know all episode  and also nicked a story by kipling   i wish we saw more of naunton wayne as the jealous husband   though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat  i love that posh bird who plays his wife  too',1

'trio s vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable  it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young  the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch observation  in film it isn t necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile   small morality  storytelling is quaint  or coy  only in the eye of the beholder  thankfully  story content  well told  can overcome it s time  subject or place ironically  there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era  inserting  small morality  content  occasionally  might provide a dimension lacking',1

'this is actually a trilogy of   of somerset maugham s short tales  the first one is the verger  which is about    minutes long and very enjoyable  after    years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can t read nor write  so what does he do  opens a tobacco shop  of course the second is mr  know all which was actually a story i had read for school   years ago and instantly forgotten  until i heard the familiar introduction  another    minute one  and also very good  it worked better on film than in a book for me  but then perhaps that s because i was only    the last time  afterall the  rd one is nearly a let down  almost an hour in length  it simply drags  it s not all that bad  but not as quick and snappy as the last    i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour  and found that it still made sense and really i hadn t missed a thing overall i give them       and   out of     respectively',1

'made after quartet was  trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham  here the three stories are the verger  mr  know it all  and sanitorium  the first two are comic  the verger is like a prolonged joke  but one with a good pay off   and the last more serious  as health issues are involved   again the author introduces the film and the stories james hayter  soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick  is the hero in the verger  he holds this small custodial type job in a church  but the new vicar  michael hordern  is an intellectual snob  when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him  hayter has saved some money  so he tells his wife  kathleen harrison  he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop  he has a good eye  and his store thrives  soon he has a whole chain of stores  when his grandchild is christened by hordern  the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex verger  the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments  i ll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting according to maugham he met a man like max kelada  nigel patrick  on a cruise  in mr  know it all kelada is a splashy  friendly  and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip  regarding jewelry  by steamship  his state room mate is mr  grey  the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde white  who is somewhat  silently disapproving of max  max likes to enliven things  and soon is heavily involved in the ship s entertainment  at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non maugham story and film china seas         as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake  after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real   i won t describe the way max rises to the occasion sanitorium is the longest segment  roland culver plays  ashenden   the fictional alter ego of maugham   a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock s the secret agent   here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health  he finds a remarkable crew of people  including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman  finlay currie as an irascible scotsman  john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is  at war  with currie  raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up  and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness  culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions  the last  dealing with simmons and rennie  is ironic but deeply moving it was a dandy follow up to the earlier quartet  and well worth watching',1

'wilhelm grimm  alexander knox  stands trial for nazi crimes  three witnesses give evidence   father warecki  henry travers   wilhelm s brother karl  erik rolf  and wilhelm s former lover marja  marsha hunt    before wilhelm speaks in his own defense  the film ends after the court sums up    the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand  the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna  shirley mills   who wilhelm is accused of raping  the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps  and the church service where willie grimm  richard crane  denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina  dorothy morris   marja s daughter  after she has been shot at a brothel throughout the film  knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter  resentful and evil man  martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest  this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished',1

'this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed  while late      and into      would reveal just how evil and horrific they were  this film  unlike other hollywood films to date  is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities the film begins in a courtroom in the future  after the war is over  the film was made in       the war ended in may         in this fictitious world court  a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes  wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm s life since      in a series of flashbacks  at first  it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis  however  after a while  it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster  these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama all in all  the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second tier actors  there are many compelling scenes and performances  especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can t help but bring you close to tears  it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first  overall  it s a must see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film fyi  this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film  but hitler was referred to as  that paper hanger   this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper  this is in fact not true  previously he d been a  starving artist   homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi  a horrible person  yes  but never a paper hanger',1

'never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example  norway  the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates  alexander knox    wilhelm gimm  gorky park  returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town  he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either  as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind  marsha hunt  marja pacierkowski   chloe s prayer   played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm  there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people s families and their entire lives  the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers  if you have not seen this film  and like this subject matter  give it some of your time  this film is very down to earth for a      film and a story you will not forget too quickly',1

'the only reason i give this movie an   out of    is because there are few movies  in my opinion  that are perfect  this little b picture is a taut story  well told  i ve always been intrigued by alexander knox  but have seen him very few movies  here he plays wilhelm grimm  a sad little man who turns into a monster  he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse  the performance is one of the most chilling performances i ve ever seen  since world war    actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars  i imagine that since this was made during the war  the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil  but knox puts in that kind of performance  a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer  i still can t get over it marsha hunt  who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly  is cast against type in probably the best performance i ve ever seen her give  too  maybe not oscar worthy  but the best of her career  nothing against her  i have enjoyed her in those  slight  roles she often played  but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama if you like human drama stories  or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis  i highly recommend this fine little film',1

'this one is tough to watch    as an earlier reviewer says  that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii    particularly the  liberation  of dachau  it is clear that  as of the middle of the war  we knew exactly what was happening to the jews  the sequence that shows a  transport  is vivid  almost as if based upon an actual newsreel  the nazis liked to record their atrocities   knox as the nazi is brilliant  he charts the course of a nazi career  that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans  at first laughing at hitler  then incredulous  and finally helpless  that contrast  however  permits us to believe in the  conversion  of one young nazi officer to an anti nazi stance  that did happen  as witness the several attempts against hitler  most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out  a strong film  effectively using flashbacks  accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended',1

'this movie was extremely funny  i would like to own this for my vintage collection of     s movie must see again list  i know this cast of characters  they are people that i have met over the years and that prompt me to search out this comedy  unfortunately this was never put to dvd or vhs  redd foxx always a clown of comedy  pearl baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy  norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out dennis dugan crazy funny man   miss dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience  love lust strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance  situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake  i do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible except jerry seinfeld playing dennis dugan role  this earmarks a couple of seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to norman is that you  keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent  this movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie  remind me of episode kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer    episode from seinfeld   the parents have there jaw dropping moment  fun over fun it is screaming bring me back',1

'norman  is that you  was  this is all third hand  so take it with a grain of salt  adapted to an african american family from a jewish one  when it made the transition off stage and onto screen  also  it was one of those movies originally filmed in video  so the prints from the theater can t have been that great  still  performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece  it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early   s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family  for that reason alone  it s pretty interesting  if not a little  hollywood   don t believe me  check out lines about curtains  etc  very stereotypical  not too deep but    the movie really shines in a couple of areas  there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife  who s run away with his brother     to ensenada in a souped up pinto  the phone conversation across the border is really memorable but    the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs  to the best of my knowledge  this is the only time that routine was filmed  and  it s a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version  i m told  still  it s vintage madame  and shouldn t be missed  people are still stealing lines from wayland  the man was truly gifted  enjoy the movie',1

'say what you will about schmaltz  one beauty of this film is that it is not pro american  it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion  it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose to me  the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly  bette davis  mother and brother   as fanny says   we ve been shaken out of the magnolias  in today s political climate where  led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used      to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings  we sunk to the level of the      murderers to seek blood thirsty vengeance  it can t all be blamed on mr  bush   after all  we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re elected him after his lies had been exposed  now  with complete justification  we americans are reviled throughout the world today  we watch this film with a new awareness  that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character  but  a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts  i m not comparing george bush to adolph hitler  but  i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror  hatred  and hyper nationalism to do despicable things sadly  the blackmailer  who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement  no matter how immoral  is most like the leaders of our country  those who support them  and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand  that they can t even be bothered to vote a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be   a force for the betterment of humanity   and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals geoff',1

'even though this movie came out a year before i was born  it is definetely one of my favorite comedies  it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son s homosexuality  like most parents  he doesn t know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like  his son  norman  is now grown up and living on his own  when his father  ben  finds out that his son is gay  he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him  the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie  when ben gets to norman s apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it s his son in drag   norman    is that you     the movie had me laughing from start to finish  redd foxx is great  although a lot of the content is stereotypical  i didn t find anything offensive about the way the material was handled  and it even has a good ending  highly recommended',1

'what was there about      that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films  well  whatever it was  the magic may also be found in this columbia picture  it s a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show   maltin s movie book does not contain it   in nearly every department  amazing mr  williams is a jewel it s the story of a first rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended  as the wedding bells are about to ring  he gets called to the scene of a murder  the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force  there are a lot of laughs in the process melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy  joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight  edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious the film goes on a bit too long  but who cares  the screwball comedies are always able to entertain  and this film belongs right in there with the best',1

'delightful minor film  juggling comedy and detective  romance and drama genres as nimbly as lt kenny williams  melvyn douglas  balances his devotion to his girl maxine carroll  joan blondell  and his duty to the force as an ace detective this hodge podge may not appeal to all viewers today  but in its day  it had something to offer every member of the movie going family  and the resolution to the rather tired feeling versus duty plot is original and refreshing  and well worth the wait  the amazing mr  williams  contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history  and its bright comic repartee sparkles  ludicrously frocked  melvyn douglas delivers some of the best lines   i d walk down main street in a turkish towel before i d let any woman control my life   and the effervescent joan blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb   good grief  you look like my aunt nellie  the crime solving here is standard fare  although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life from today s vantage point   the amazing mr  williams  is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct  all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries  while much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes  at times it is both subtle and penetrating  playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film  but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene',1

'this movie is very good  the screenplay is enchanting  but meryl streep is most impressive  her performance is excellent  she brings me to go into the heart of her role',1

'this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all  generally speaking  i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories  and this one is great  besides meryl s performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise  the movie s greatest asset is the story it is based on  the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture  after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans  and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society  it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people  the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example  are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would  for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices  shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions  the other face of the so called  civilized  society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings  needless to say  this is very general  even though this specific tale unfolds in australia   that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty  must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought provoking',1

'when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock  australia  lindy chamberlain  meryl streep  sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience  for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press  and the whole thing turns into a circus  lindy doesn t help matters either because she won t play to the jury or courtroom  she s only herself  and she s a tough nut to crack  so of course everyone thinks she s guilty because there s a piece of evidence that hasn t come to light  sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain  a seventh day adventist pastor  who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife  it s good  or bad  to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too  because the australian public doesn t believe the story and the media only fans the flames  eventually  lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor  but years later  a missing piece of evidence shows up and she s freed  but not until after the family s life is basically ruined  a heart breaking story  very well done  a bit long but well worth seeing    out of',1

'religious bigotry is rampant everywhere  australia is not immune to it a dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having  killed  her own baby  i don t mean to spoil the story for you  but you need to know the basics before getting knee deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison buy or rent the movie and discover how deep seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe this is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors both meryl streep  with her famous aussie accent  and sam neill  whose accent is his native born pronunciation  are outstanding  those with supporting roles are also quite good you will remember this movie for many years see it',1

'this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based the right to be presumed  innocent until proven guilty  is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society  but according to fred schepisi s partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial  it was not granted to lindy chamberlain  accused of killing her baby  the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely  a dingo was alleged to have taken it   but those implying her guilt even more so  and there was no solid evidence against her  but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt  and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media  and the media themselves  of course  were anything but innocent in this process   so although cleared by an initial inquest  they were later prosecuted and convicted  although chamberlain was eventually released  this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence  proving  their innocence  something no defendants should have to produce  a cry in the dark  is well acted throughout  especially by meryl streep  who puts on a convincing australian accent  at least to this pom s ears  and manages keep lindy sympathetic  to us  while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure  the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking  because we believe in the characters as real regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story  something i can t comment on   the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership s least charitable instincts  no legal system will ever be perfect  but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away  i m not a religious man  but the bible still contains some killer lines  if you ll excuse the pun    judge not lest ye be judged  is one of them',1

'a cry in the darka cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid  if unremarkable film  this assumption came from the fact that aside from streep s best actress nomination  the movie received little attention from major awards groups little did i anticipate that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama  well constructed on every level  if you ask me  this is an under appreciatted classic the film opens rather slowly  letting the audience settle into the chamberlain s at a relaxed pace and really notice that  at the core  they are an incredibly loving  simple family  fred schepisi  the director  selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy  while also showing the attentive bliss with which lindy  streep  and michael  sam neill  chamberlain care for their children while the famous line  a dingo took my baby   has become somewhat of a punchline these days  the movie never even comes close to laughable  the actual death of azaria is horrifyingly captured  it is subtle and realistic  leaving the audience horrified and asking questions the majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the chamberlain s continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court  which suspects lindy of murder the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping  as an audience member  i was fully invested in the chamberlain s plight    and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media  but at the same  the media public opinion is understandable  i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic  but they always had valid reasons to hold their views the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas in terms of performances  the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and neill    and they deliver in every way  for me  this ranks as one of  if not     meryl streep s best performances  for all her mastery of different accents  which of course are very impressive in their own right   streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters  i find this to be one of streep s more subtle performances  and she hits it out of the park  and neill  an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park  is a perfect counterpoint to streep s performance  from what i ve seen  this is undoubtedly neill s finest work to date  it s a shame he wasn t recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match streep s    b c the two of them play of each other brilliantly more emotionally gripping than most films  and also incredibly suspenseful    a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations  i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams  the dingo took my baby   watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line     a',1

'fascinating movie  based on a true story  about an australian woman  lindy chamberlain  meryl streep  accused of killing her baby daughter  she insists that a dingo took her baby  but the story is highly suspicious  the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case  the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media  and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman s conviction  based on barely any hard evidence  i love films that question the media  and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system  i ve always thought that juries ought to be showed    angry men before they go through with their duties  it s not  as has often been said  a liberal movie  but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge  a cry in the dark is likewise clinical  schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic  some may find the film boring or dry  but i found it engaging',1

'in august      the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation  the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood  what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock  central australia  that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area  no one believed them  lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael as an accessory after the fact  the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing  the chamberlain s trial was over before it began lindy never proved her innocence  so she was found guilty  there was never enough evidence to convict her  yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure  how could we as a nation even sit in judgement  from where we are  how could we possibly presume to know  unless there was absolute proof  and no reasonable doubt whatsoever  the chamberlains should have been acquitted fred schepisi s film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson s novel  that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them  that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation  hell bent on  the truth  being brought to light  he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay  his screenplay  co written with robert caswell  vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts  she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight  even her accent is almost  but not quite  spot on  a very good effort by the master of that trade  sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart  and he starts to question his christianity  his  as was streep s  is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly  the entire support cast are also excellent  with some of australia s finest actors and actresses playing a part technically the film is brilliant too  with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour  especially the rock   editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged  while bruce smeaton provides a telling score for all aussies this is a must see  a shocking look in the mirror if you will  at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served  and the truth to be known  as michael chamberlain said    i don t think anybody really understands what innocence means     to innocent people  saturday  may            videoeven on return viewings fred schepisi s account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains  who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in       is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson s novel to the screen  telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain  whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact  what followed was little more than trial by media  and with the australian people determined she be put away  lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour  even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence  she is truly awesome  and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent  though she does her level best to sound ocker  you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn t cast in the role  but star power is probably the answer  alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill  outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes  while he feels powerless to do anything about it  a strong aussie cast lend compelling support editing from jill bilcock is very timely  ian baker s cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton s music is perfect for the part  truly a must for all conscientious australians sunday  june            video',1

'i found it hard to like anyone in this film  the central characters  lindy and michael chamberlain  whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback  are not bad people  but then surely not all  or even most  of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better  but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life s tragic disarray  the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip  news media  crowds  mobs and assumptions  it s not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular  it s merely an account of a true story that happened there  society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine s dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog  when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines  newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy  there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one s own unaware perceptions  influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one s life  the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out  from the victims to the masses the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside  suspicion was jet fueled mostly by a virtue of hers  to the public eye  she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter  why was she able to keep her cool  even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up  for tv and the press  how much of the downward spiral could ve been prevented had she behaved more to the public s liking in the media  meryl streep  one of  if not the  greatest actress working today  may not give a performance that particularly stands out  and frankly neither does any other actor  or department of film making  but she  and the screenwriters  do understand lindy  what is infuriating is that it s not that difficult  apparently  she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case  whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense  we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie s choice  the devil wears prada  angels in america or other such work  it is a triumph  it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself  she frustrates us because we don t know what she s thinking or feeling  it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her  but this is the movie s way of suggesting the reaction of the public s attention she is married to a pastor  and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most  initially  they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god s will  kick starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter s death was some sort of ritual killing on their part  whatever happened to the little girl  her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media s intake didn t immediately identify  so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry   well   meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen  but the australian public plays the real leads here  like punctuation for each plot advance  director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office  where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections this golan globus docudrama is not particularly memorable  the setting s atmosphere doesn t give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out  but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public',1

'i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story  several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie  the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself  the cast just makes it that much more appealing  meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture  she nails mrs  chamberlain s mannerisms  the accent  and even look  she shows the pain  hurt  surprise  and anger that lindy had to endure  and in the process it s hard to remember that it isn t lindy  in my opinion  this performance of meryl s was better than her oscar winning turn in  sophie s choice   and should have garnered her her third oscar  sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain  and for some surprising reason  wasn t recognized by the academy with at least a nomination  in all  this movie only receive one oscar nod  streep s for best actress   however  it did receive several australian oscars and nominations definitely a top rate movie  it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast',1

'this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it s impact on australian society  it especially looks at the problem of innuendo  gossip and expectation when dealing with real life dramas one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations  not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis  just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so  this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings  it s an issue that has to be constantly addressed the leads play the characters with depth  personality and sensitivity  and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based on fact individuals  some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors  it re enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals  spoiler warning  i have to say something very personal here  in that i am actually an ex adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred  so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most  i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality  and emotional heart  i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers  it captured the themes of the story brilliantly i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to  play the best case for their character they could   while this is especially apt for this story  i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well',1

'meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense  based on the book  evil angels  and titled so in its australian release  a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch  it presents a scenario that s all too real for us in america  the witch hunt against a person deemed an easy target lindy chamberlain was this woman  being someone who spoke her mind  someone who didn t play the sympathy card  and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal  she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn t kill her own child  the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece  and through it all  lindy remained as stoic as ever  even when her husband michael was falling apart this stance  of course  is the power of strength  as unsympathetic as it may look like  and people happen to react strongly to that  they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn  not sit there and look blank  people don t understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations  meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold  but not unfeeling woman  one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty  because of her  sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair    someone has to  or the chamberlains would be too detached  and no one wants to see that  except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news media  they ll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public',1

'spoilers following  i picked up the book  evil angels  when it first came out knowing nothing of the case  just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here  i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain s guilt  the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did  john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors  and picked up by the press  of the arterial spray  the actelone      plates  dr  james cameron s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors  that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up  bloody hand print  etc  all quite convincingly  after all  these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie  and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn t apparent to me at all  it was also highly technical evidence  difficult for a layman to understand  to this point  beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials  hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human  people didn t believe it was possible  the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists  whose origins made them appear to be a cult  and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt  were it not for dedicated  selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony  finding azaria s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail  the book shook me for that reason  and i ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone s guilt ever since  excepting oj of course   i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don t think it could have been done better  i ve always liked sam  who i could identify with completely  and meryl was perfect as always  beautiful photography  haunting music  i think it s not only a very good  but a very important  movie  too bad it didn t receive more publicity at the time it was released',1

'this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears  meryl streep is excellent  as always  and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn t particularly likable the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the    s  these real life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled  i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating  why isn t sam sheppard in jail    the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure  and sheppard was tried and convicted  only after years in jail was he exonerated i love movies which tell a true story  do it in an interesting way  and make an important point in the process  this is one of those movies  other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include  hurricane    the thin blue line   and  breaker morant   in particular  the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended',1

'an unqualified       the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of  old  hollywood  sam neill and meryl streep are very good together  neill matches streep line for line  and take for take    it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best  notwithstanding the intensity of his role  this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama  portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms  the movie    which won several top awards in australia    boasts not only a superlative cast and director  but wonderful and authentic australian locales  it proves that people are the same the world over  and  after all these years  people still delight in repeating the famous streep line  accent and all   a dingo ate moy baby   including that imp  elaine benis  on  seinfeld',1

'when i first saw  a cry in the dark   i had no idea what the plot was  but when i saw it  i was shocked at what it portrayed  when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class  i realized a second point  communication issues  you see  when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain s  meryl streep  baby  she and her husband michael  sam neill  were grief stricken but didn t show it  as seventh day adventists  they believed that god willed this to happen  and so they couldn t mourn it  but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness  everyone started believing that lindy did it herself the point is  the wrong message got communicated to the public  and it turned people against lindy  even though this was a pure accident  it still happened  it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media  regardless of any media outlet s political views as for the performances  streep does a very good job with an australian accent  no surprise there   and sam neill is equally great  you will probably get blown away just by what you see here  definitely one of fred schepisi s best movies ever',1

'a cry in the dark  is a masterful piece of cinema  haunting  and incredibly though provoking  the true story of lindy chamberland  who  in       witnessed a horrific sight  seeing her   month old baby being brutally taken from their family s tent  while camping on the austrailian outback  azaria  the baby  was never seen again  and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world  meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy  as she always does  but the one thing that helps  a cry in the dark  never fall flat is the brilliant direction  a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case  tears are brought to the eyes  the concept is nothing less then terrifying  and afterwards you are left haunted  but also inspired',1

'watch on the rhine is one of the best anti nazi propaganda films made during world war two  paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar  bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was  i would recommend this film to those interested in that era  and  of course  the fabulous films of the late  great  ms  bette davis',1

'some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them  as i watched this film  made in       in       i thought i was watching the o j  simpson debacle  although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation  the australian news media  if this movie is to be believed  devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought  it was scary to see the scenes of invasive  swarming media hordes  ridiculous accounts of half truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society equally appalling is the media s depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case  i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case  the accused are seven day adventists  today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important streep is excellent as usual  and this is the best i ve ever seen sam neill  the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible',1

'this is an extremely powerful based on a true story film that can be infuriating to watch  i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people  in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good  let s just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent   she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts  without giving anything away  all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally',1

'plato s run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer  scarface  and action star jeff speaksman  the expert   what i liked about plato s run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato s sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato s run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it   out of',1

'the previous reviewer has said it exactly  i saw it once  was enchanted  saw it a second time when it was re broadcast within a week or two of the first airing  i still remember some of the scenes  the setting is the opening of the   th century  the war referred to in the title is world war i  one of the scenes was set in a women only section of a public place  which was an interesting historical note  the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all time great movie moments  i don t think of this as a  gay movie   it s an interesting and tender period love story  where the two principals happen to be women  i would love to see this movie again  i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd',1

'i saw this movie in       my first year of living in new york  i went on to live there for the next    years but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie  it was part of a pbs series as i recall  and i ve never forgotten it there are no sex scenes to speak of  just delicate  moving  extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement  all set within a conservative  boston  i think   world war   environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war  and did not seek out a career and financial independence  frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next    odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail there has to be a video of this movie  sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video',1

'what is wrong with you people  if you weren t blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head  of course the film isn t a masterpiece  i don t think it was aiming to be  it was fun and funny  i never watched the show when i was younger  i only recently saw one episode  and when i watched the movie  i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere  the movie seats were practically shaking  and the car sequences were good because it didn t bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in  fast  furious  and jessica simpson is plain hot  i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences  all in all  i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd  people  enjoy it for what it is',1

'next to  star wars  and  the wizard of oz   this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made  it s a true shame it s not as well known as the former films  maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci fi settings  and that it s british  meaning a smaller market for films  but its wonderful to know that it s deserved that reputation like all great family films  one can be a child  an adult  or even a teenager to enjoy this film  i m currently      but one must appreciate classic films first  i absolutely adore this film  it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa  perhaps my favorite classic film score  that rivals any john williams  star wars  score  a fast but not flashy pace  beautiful sets  dialog  and use of color  both the sets and cinematography won oscars   and state of the art oscar winning special effects  for the time  and some are still stunning   and  of course  june duprez s sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta jones   she even looks like jones in a way   in conclusion  this is one of my all time favorite movie  next to  the adventures of robin hood   and it truly deserves more attention  it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout  and  along with  robin hood   it s my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed stars        excellent',1

'let s cut a long story short  i loved every minute of it  a lavish fantasy in true arabian nights style  there s an evil magician  a pretty princess  a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after  modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic  only quibble  the special effects are pretty dated  loved sabu with the djinn s foot  though',1

'a magical journey concocted by alexander korda and michael powell  these two titans of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece  some of the most ravishing early technicolor  a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu  the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well  miles malleson who plays duprez father  the sultan of basra  also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose  don t miss this one  since posting the above comments  i have obtained the recently released dvd and can honestly say i d never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer  again  a must see',1

'a fantastic arabian adventure  a former king  ahmad  and his best friend  the thief abu  played by sabu of black narcissus  search for ahmad s love interest  who has been stolen by the new king  jaffar  conrad veidt   there s hardly a down moment here  it s always inventing new adventures for the heroes  personally  i found ahmad and his princess a little boring  there s no need to ask why john justin  who plays ahmad  is listed fourth in the credits   conrad veidt  always a fun actor  makes a great villain  and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves  who at one point finds a genie in a bottle  i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra  the father of the princess  he collects amazing toys from around the world  jaffar bribes him for his daughter s hand with a mechanical flying horse  this probably would count as one of the great children s films of all time  but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays  kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together  and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful  although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time  willis o brien s stop motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn t even look remotely like a spider',1

'this was usually producer alexander korda s advice on set to many of his underlings  the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex  zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out  pushing it to six for john kobal s      book   the top     movies   his survey of    film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach   th place  a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner  john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture  but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half way mark the outbreak of the second world war saw the movie s production shifted around england and america  eventually seeing completion in      and winning three technical oscars  like citizen kane  it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love the special effects  outstanding for the time  are still reasonable  and actually hold up if you squint  but it s not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions  among them is an amusing horse  constructed out of a kit model  which  when a key is inserted up it s rear end  begins to fly  there s also a killer toy of the six armed goddess kali   perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her  and a quite horrific looking giant spider  also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet  but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as  in a superb moment of cinematic conceit  a djinn  genie  nearly a thousand feet tall  ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature  and adds an element of danger to the proceedings  and look out for the moment where he s tricked back into his bottle john justin does well as the arabic king who  for some strange reason  has an english accent and a stiff upper lip  sabu  the astonishingly muscled   year old  is near namesake abu  a likeably cocky thief  after they cross paths with the evil jaffer  conrad veidt   justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog  when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed s  justin s  perspective  we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues  in truth  the second half is someway the better  being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature three small songs pepper the piece  though as the film lasts for     minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient  i wouldn t classify this as a musical  it s all great fun  justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads  veidt is the boo hiss villain  and abu is the youthful  irrepressible robber  it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of   s english movies  but once you ve sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in  quite commendable',1

'the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself  almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film  alexander korda nearly went broke making this film according to the citadel film series book about the great british films  adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as      and spent years of planning and preparation  but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle budget costs happen in us films too  only cecil b  demille always had a free hand at paramount after      when he returned there  but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film  part of the way through the shoot  korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon  he certainly wasn t going to get scenery like that in the uk  korda also finished the interiors in hollywood  all in time for a release on christmas day      the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography  best art set  direction for a color film  and best special effects  only miklos rosza s original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category  korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it s impossible to get bad color pictures from that place the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil  the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart  both belonging to duprez  this was veidt s career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source  beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star  literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features  sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant  not a bad message to be sending out in      at that the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today  it s an eternal tale of love  romance  and adventure in any order you want to put it',1

'although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special if you ve never seen this film before you ll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers  i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney s aladdin cribbed from the film  they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers i ve given the film an   out of    instead of a    out of ten  which is where a good portion of this film dwells  because in the final    minutes the film falls apart in the pacing  everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end  from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting  it doesn t kill the film  but it does weaken it still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale  or even a great movie',1

'this was a favorite of my childhood   i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time  now that i m grown up and have a kid of my own  i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie  we watched it last friday  and he liked it  during abu s fight with the giant spider  my son s hand crept over and took hold of mine   he was genuinely scared   is he gonna beat the spider  poppa   just watch  you ll see  he has no historical frame of reference to speak of  eight years old   so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al raschid might as well be oz under ozma i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring do were perpetrated by the boy thief  and not the grown up king  in fact  if you deconstruct the film s narrative a bit  the king is the thief s sidekick  not the hero at all   which must be very satisfying to imaginative  adventurous young boys it s definitely a period piece   i suspect that by the time he s eleven or twelve  my son will find it  corny  or whatever word the next generation will be using by then  the love story is barely one dimensional   as a cynical friend commented   why does ahmad love the princess  because the narrative demands it   the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy  repeatedly  for the clueless  love struck deposed king is equally improbable  but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses  fifty foot genies and the temple of the all seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme  the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie s climax is tremendous  as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his  stolen  magic carpet  seeking  some fun  and adventure at last',1

'i have seen this film several times  and watched it today  on tcm  solely because of geraldine fitzgerald  she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her  probably in  wuthering heights     or more years ago   the real star in this movie  however  is paul lukas  and he deserved all the accolades he got  he makes it clear  whether we like it or not  that the end justifies the means  naziism had to be stopped  and anything that helped do it was good  he gave his children a line about being bad  and that they should not be bad  but as he said earlier when conversing with adults  he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation  lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation  and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do some people think his victim was a nazi  but i don t think so   i think he was only after the money  his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him one interesting point in the film  and presumably also in the play  is the fact that muller  lucas  is a german  while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii  there was considerable anti german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry  it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time  maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi soviet pact    after all  the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians  i think  however  that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later  after  watch on the rhine  was released the title is something of a play on words  as the  watch  is looking west  from germany  in fact  watch am rhein was a german army marching song   used in wwii  but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well  but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own  wach am rhein  all the other actors did an excellent job here  although bodo was too much there are children like him  i am surprised he did not give his father s secret away  in real life  he may very well have done so',1

'probably the finest fantasy film ever made  sumptuous colour  spectacular sets  incredible  spot on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood  acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands  but here the poetic dialog is deftly  sensitively spoken  the humour is subtle and delightful as well  doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one  along with  the four feathers          one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films   and one of the finest motion pictures ever made a true  compelling classic',1

'words can hardly describe it  so i ll be brief   the thief of bagdad  was my favorite movie as a child  and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me  i loved this film from the first moment i saw it  when i was a boy of six who had started reading  the arabian nights   i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu s battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled rarely has so much beauty  magic  and wonder been captured on film  sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros  conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar  and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie  georges perinal s photography is some of the best use of technicolor  one of the three credited directors is michael powell  a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films  including  a matter of life and death   aka  stairway to heaven   and  the red shoes   he is one of the true masters of the camera  right up there with david lean  akira kurosawa  and orson welles as with all great works of art  the beauty of  the thief of bagdad  lies in the detail  every frame has its own magical charm  the story never lags  and the characters and their actions are always involving  here is a film that will never grow old',1

'i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess  as any kid would be  i was delighted with the imagination  inventiveness and energy of the film  several years later  i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing  i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years  in addition to the script  the production transcends the fantasy genre  this is korda  the storyteller at his very best  when you see thief as a child you know that you ve had a great time  when you see thief as an adult you know that you ve seen a masterpiece  it s as timeless as the story it treats  an amazing work thomas mccarthy',1

'despite having   different directors  this fantasy hangs together remarkably well it was filmed in england  nowhere near morocco  in studios and on a few beaches  at the outbreak of war  everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song    i want to be a bandit  can t you understand it   it remains a favourite of many people',1

'this film  was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that  unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it s quality while i grew up  this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children  it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well  the only drawback there is  is that one can not see past the bad  effects  compared to the effects nowadays  like one could when one was a child  i remembered nothing of those effects  of course it had been about ten years since i d seen this film  when i was about eleven years old  who then watches effects  one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides  in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the   th century  coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film  there is comedy  romance and adventure all in one  which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern  it succeeds in not being dusty and old  all of that is mainly due to the great story  the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors  in that department sabu  as abu  and conrad veidt  as jaffar  stand out  providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part  great film and although an  oldie   definitely a goldie   i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday   out of',1

'the story line of  the thief of bagdad  is complex  owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together  the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas  he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar s deeds and hate him  he is imprisoned by jaffar  where he meets abu the young thief  the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra  there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by  ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden  he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss  then he is captured  when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself  ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog  jaffar then asks for the princess s hand  and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra  the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace  accompanied by abu as his dog  the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her  so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog  in hopes the prince can rouse her  he does awaken her  she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad  but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard  she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms  on his promise to restore ahmad s sight and turn abu back into a thief  the princess sees a vision of ahmad  he is in a boat  jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island  abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle  abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel  then corks him in again  for freeing him  he gets three wishes  his first is for sausages  in the meanwhile  the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar  but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy  one of whose six arms stabs him to death  abu makes a second wish  to find ahmad  the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all seeing eye  abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye  battling a giant spider  then scaling the goddess s statue  abu gazes into the  eye  and sees ahmad in a canyon  he has the genie take him to ahmad  ahmad uses the eye to see the princess  she smells a flower and forgets everything at once  abu wishes they were in bagdad  but the genie laughs and leaves  jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him  omitting mention of ahmad  ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess  but jaffar smashes the  eye   abu finds himself in the  land of legend   where the old men who rule want to make him their king  he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead  to hurry to save ahmad and the princess  the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner  using his bow from the flying carpet  to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution  jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse  but another shot from the bow finishes him  ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess  but when he tries to make abu his vizier  the young thief refuses  saying that what he wants is adventure  not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be  this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda  the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director  while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography  the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell  with tim whelan  alexander korda  william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating  the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong  oliver messel and marcel vertes  the production  apart from its gorgeous and expensive looking visual splendors  i claim is dominated by two other elements  the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar  rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent  plus his usual intelligence and power  june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima  and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan  as ahmad  john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some  he is memorably good in his winning role  this film has a spaciousness about it that is found  i assert  in other korda works also  its imaginative content stands in contrast to very strong realistic sets  costumes and set design elements  this is one of the most memorable idea level fantasies of all time  worthy to be enjoyed over and over',1

'i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once  the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious   you sons of a thousand fleas  it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about      am once and it had just started  tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work',1

'the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful  but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad  the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with  but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her  jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog  this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa  restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess  during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds  a giant spider that s really hungry  and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen  this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses  genies  flying carpets  and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs  it doesn t have any cheesy moments and the love story isn t a waste of time  the production designs are just stunning in this movie  from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter  even though this movie is over    years old  the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today s cinema  the music and songs are also well done  anyone who sees it will no doubt hail   i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas  as one of the great musical moments in movies  i m usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but i ll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie  what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don t see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like  two towers  and  silent hill   way before today s modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place  one of my favorite shots in  two towers  is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates  the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor  and that s what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie  they re just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they re all just fantasy beings  it s literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of  aladdin  got their inspiration  the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet  it s not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it s nice to know that i m not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie  i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it s amazing  that s a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time  sure  the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the    s so give it a break  not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today s standard  if you ever wanted to see a live action version of  aladdin  then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won t be their cup of tea',1

'outstanding film of      with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of      encounting treachery around them  lukas successfully deals with the situation  he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn like shedding of tears when they must part  resolute  she knows that her older son  must follow him on his path to liberty a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe',1

'the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all time favorite movies  it is exciting without gore  it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless  the casting couldn t have been better  rex ingram made me believe in genies  and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar  he set the bar very high   i watch this movie at least twice a year   and never tire of it  this film is an adventure for all ages  no one too old to enjoy it  the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time   i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u s  was just about to enter wwii  conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying  evilness  a few years later in  casablanca   and korda teamed up i believe  with justin and dupree again in  the four feathers     great film making',1

'an utterly beautiful film  one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do  in thief s case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time  by the     s my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa s stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out  but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne  after escaping with a little thief played by sabu  ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures  although apparently not enough for sabu   and love not only conquers but annihilates everything  the special effects must have been mesmerising in       but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from    years later  anyway  if i m requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies  flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects  favourite bits  the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall s suitably romantic song  the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend  in fact  the stunning colours throughout  sabu and rozsa s triumphant but still wistful finale  conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever  this and casablanca  and then died  john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers  both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted  but the parts didn t call for a huge range of emotions  only pure love mattered there s a couple of mildly violent images in it  but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a      positive message  it s only a pity that nowadays little kids don t watch this instead of the porn they prefer  one of my top    film favourites  i can t recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of time',1

'the thief of bagdad is a treasure  first and foremost  it is a good story  though my four children s primary exposure to this tale  the most famous of the stories of the arabian nights  comes from the disney corporation  the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end  the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability  sabu  who plays the young thief  abu  also measures up to any of today s teen actors in appeal  judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say   he s c u t e  in       the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects  today  of course  those effects seem very dated   look  it s barbie flying through the air   declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying   yet they fit into the story well  the film is  after all  over    years old  the effects fit with the script  furthermore  what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state of the art for the next twenty five years  one need only compare the opening montage from a      star trek episode to see this  in that  it was quite an achievement this qualifies as a family film  though there are a few stabbings near the end  the acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation all in all  a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment  or for the historical value of the effects  i recommend it',1

'i grew up with this as my all time favorite film  the special effects are incredible for the era  and won awards  i can remember the dialogue as if i d heard it yesterday  it is simply a great  timeless adventure  the music is by miklos rosza  who is cinema history s best  sabu is the thief  conrad veidt is the grand villain  i have a copy within reach  for the next trip down memory lane  whoa there  rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle',1

'i first discovered alexander korda s        fantasy  the thief of bagdad in the early      s on a re issue billed as  the wonder show of the century   both korda technicolor films  the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program  the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films  the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful  the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made  as the years passed  it became more difficult to enjoy the film s color in the way it had originally been presented in  true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle      s  both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video  but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor  the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it    nice  but not as it should be  now comes the m g m dvd    dec       issue  the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning    it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once  i watched it a second time  the only  extras  are a spanish dubbed version  sub titles in both english   spanish  and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer  thank you m g m for this exceptional dvd release  now  one can only hope that korda s four feathers and a restored version of korda s jungle book  to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation  will soon follow on dvd',1

'like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there s plot  plot and more plot  it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life  then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man s present  where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come   it must be admitted that the second half doesn t quite live up to the promise of the first   like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work  a freed genie  a beautiful princess  a flying carpet  fantastic mechanical toys  sea voyages  a crowded marketplace  a wicked vizier  jewels     i don t know why it all works  but it does  everything is just so beautiful  the sets are beautiful  june duprez is beautiful  rozsa s score is especially beautiful  as usual  it sounds hungarian  but somehow he manages to convince us that he s being hungarian in a persian way',1

'the thief of bagdad  is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar  conrad veidt   he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad  and a gorgeous princess from her father   he falls victim in the end  as all tyrants do  in books and legends  to love and of the common man whom he ignored  here embodied by the little thief  sabu  the armies of good and evil  black and white  are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms   the script is poetic  simply and very beautiful    the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds  attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror   the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes  and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues   for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before  while through its use of color  it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before   with flying carpet and flying white horse  with a giant genie  excellently played by rex ingram   with evil wizards  and with the good acting of sabu and veidt   the thief of bagdad  captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights   the      version remains the screen s finest fairy tale',1

'the story of the boy thief of bagdad  as it was once spelled  has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in       who starred douglas fairbanks in the first  silent  rendering of  thief of bagdad   to less imposing  more recent attempts  the best  however  remains      s version which for its time was a startling  magical panoply of top quality special effects  those effects still work their charm no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief  abu  john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch  ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier  jaffar  played by a sinister conrad veidt  the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent  he and the boy  abu  suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates  ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt  their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado like black swirl  lawrence w  butler and tom howard   howard  incidentally  did the special effects for the      version of this film  both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry  duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting  justin s ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses  sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he s very good  for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there s a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind  still  i don t think anyone under eight ought to see  thief of bagdad  this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present  it was great to see computer besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them  thief of bagdad  is a pre war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases  this is one of the best of its kind',1

'i have to agree with mr  caruso jr lanza s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it  see the film you ll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house  someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn t good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring',1

'watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non aggression pact signed in august of       so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line  the line didn t change until a couple of months later  lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work the play watch on the rhine ran from april      to february      for     performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler  eric roberts as the youngest son  lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas lukas pulled an award hat trick in      winning an oscar  a golden globe  and the new york film critics for best actor  probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well  the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against  humphrey bogart for casablanca  gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls  mickey rooney in the human comedy  and walter pidgeon for madame curie  every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was  lukas s nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas s wife was given to bette davis  davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her  but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it  it s the same reason she did the man who came to dinner  a much lighter play than this one davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days  after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe  davis lukas  and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war  they re made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren the fly in this ointment are some other house guests  a friend of davis s from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe  a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris  coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas s anti fascist background his suspicions are quite correct  it s the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they ve become  lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there  his health has not been the same since  his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes  those decisions affect all the other members of the cast adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman s significant other  coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell  kurt katch  clyde fillmore  erwin kalser and rudolph anders coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count  he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in       but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls  dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti fascist classic  casablanca though it s an item firmly planted in those specific times  watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti fascist message that bears repeating infinitely',1

'the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza  he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer  paired with dorothy kirsten  soprano of the metropolitan opera  indeed  i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso  check a vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini   the mgm art and music departments also did a good job  this movie could be perfect  were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth  we see that she is trying her best  dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before        unforgivable  lanza deserved a better leading lady  and blyth should stick to less demanding productions  also notice that ms  kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza  giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano',1

'since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio  i doubt we will ever get a real life story of enrico caruso but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until metro goldwyn mayer had mario lanza under contract  no one else could have done it  i doubt whether it will ever be tried again and why should it  i think enrico caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen  for his tenor voice was his life  his reason for being on the earth to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest  caruso  like the man who portrayed him  was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline  he had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought  he s shown in a recording studio once late in his life  actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish tenor john mccormack for rca victor made the recording industry what it became when caruso and mccormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live  but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men  it s why both became the legends that they are what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by mario lanza  a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera  the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of songs from the great caruso  unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn t get an actual cast album with ann blyth  dorothy kirsten  and jarmila novotna also though blyth sang it in the film  lanza had a big hit recording of the loveliest night of the year further helping to popularize the great caruso if you re looking for a life of enrico caruso  this ain t it  if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career  than you should not miss the great caruso',1

'jesse and celine  ethan hawke and julie delpy  are two strangers on a european train  the two come from widely different backgrounds  he s american and she s french  after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him  during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other  but will this newfound relationship last past sunrise this wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline  written and directed by richard  dazed and confused  linklater   before sunrise  never bores because of its  small cast  in fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two  smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans',1

'amazing movie that  in theory  should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding  instead of relying on clichs and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments  the lead characters are not perfect  and so relating to them as people you could know is easy  the movie is not trying to pull laughs  or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel  a moving  thought provoking  funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany s  will soften even the hardiest heart',1

'i m not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good  i was stunned  easily the most romantic thing i ve ever seen in my life  stunning  brilliant  sweet  funny and full of heart  the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they re a couple the movies grabs you right away and doesn t let go  you can t look away nor can you stop listening to them  even the little moments just melt your heart this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever  a masterpiece',1

'an american woman  her european husband and children return to her mother s home in  watch on the rhine   a      film based on the play by lillian hellman  and starring paul lukas  whom i believe is repeating his stage role here   bette davis  lucile watson  george coulouris  geraldine fitzgerald  and donald woods  an anti fascist  a worker in the underground movement  many times injured  and wanted by the nazis  kurt muller  lukas  is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother in law  but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests  coulouris  is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out great performances abound in this film  written very much to put forth lillian hellman s liberal point of view  it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released  as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes  the movie s big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in  casablanca   humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick  but lukas is transcendent as kurt  the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut wrenching  just to mention one scene though this isn t what one thinks of as a bette davis movie  she gives a masterful performance here as kurt s loyal and loving wife  sara  her acting tugs at the heart  and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions  lillian hellman is not everyone s cup of tea  but unlike  the little foxes   she has written some truly sympathetic  wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers  highly recommended',1

'i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago  having saw it twice  i couldn t help but missing before sunrise  not because the sequel was not as great  but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did  every time i finished watching one of them  i feel the need and yearning to see the other  so  i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly  i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly  the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other  it sounds so simple  the growing of the chemistry  i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development  but to me   who doesn t believe in nora ephron   before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it  when i saw it for the first time  about   year ago when i was     i already liked it  but  i didn t rate it as a  great film   it still seemed to me like another thinking persons  feel good movie  linklater was too smart to make it more realistic  it was    minutes too long  the characters was too well fabricated  i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations  etc  etc   but now  thanks to before sunset  i feel that s more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before  i saw the elements more clearly  jesse  celine  vienna  their conversations  everything  how each of them are separated element by itself  and they have a chance to mix  the story is just a frame of time  i am no longer feel manipulated  and the freedom that every scene has  as well as its refusal to be overly efficient  how blind i was that those qualities didn t strike me as exceptional when i first saw it  now    year have passed  the more movies i ve seen  the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending  even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters s own slackers included  the jesse and celine tale avoid that  maybe before sunset is a better example in this case  but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time  not a destination  every single scene has its own life  i don t know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise  but to me  one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other  before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes  seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine  the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it  meanwhile  i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset  and celine s first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i ve seen in a beginning of a film  and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don t know with a sadness in me  no matter how beautiful paris is  and no matter how happy i am that they meet again  i m sorry that i go on this long with my limited english  before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts  and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it',1

'i m not even sure what to say about this film  it s one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic  to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa  like dancing about architecture   it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again  this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write  the ending is left open and ambiguous  no happy ending here  just mystery  no profound life lessons  just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings       romantic love    out of    watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger',1

'i must admit that at the beginning  i was sort of reticent about watching this movie  i thought it was this stupid  little  romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him  i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script  since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie  still  i watched it  and i was amazed    before sunrise  is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way  wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth  we are sentenced to death  or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity  or that  we  humans  can afford sometimes to live in fairy tales the ending was wonderfully chosen  we do not know if they will meet again in six months  at six o clock  in vienna s station   in our optimism  we sincerely hope so  the actors acted in a very good manner  so  that  i began to believe that i  myself could live a love story just like this',1

'american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa  on the train he met a french girl celine  although they met the first time  they talked like good friends  when the train stopped at vienna  jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna  then the romantic story unfolded at first they were cautious  the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store  they peeked at each other  though their eyes did not contact  after in depth conversation  they relationship became close  then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend  their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words love is a strange thing  when you really want it  it will not come as you wished  love needs mutual understanding  without it  love will not last long  spiritual harmony is the most important for love excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie one of the best romance movies',1

'the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation  the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed  ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch  a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love  by far the most romantic at least one of them  movie of all times',1

'i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of  before sunrise         and  before sunset          and saw both films in a row  without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately  after sleeping it over  i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter  and i shall explain why before sunrise introduces us with then young actors  ethan hawke  reality bites  dead poets society   only    at the time of the film s release  and julie delpy  the three colors trilogy   then     although looking much younger   he is a promiscuous american writer  touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend  she is a young french student  on her way home to paris  they meet on the budapest vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together  the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna  exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love the film has      s written all over it  back then  technology was leaping rapidly  the new millennium with all it s hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner  and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future  the characters of jesse  hawke  and celine  delpy   with all their flaws and inconsistencies  celine s accent  if by mistake or on purpose  was half american half french  and it swinged from one spectrum to the other  breaking the character s credibility   were a mirror of the time  watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement  acting all clichd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well  is what really made this movie work for me  the fact that the director doesn t let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while all in all  sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna  a well told classical romantic rendezvous  and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future',1

'after a chance encounter on the train  a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna  discussing life and love  the primary reason to see  before sunrise   is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines  as  celine   this sexy  brainy  soulful brown eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid twenties  risking overstatement  celine is practically the ideal woman  unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural  unpretentious  introspective  and selflessly loving  we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak  for her sincere  intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating  further  her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie  it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar  ethan hawke as  jessie  comes off like a vaguely appealing slob  sort of a maynard g  krebs of the nineties  attempting to appear detached and nonchalant  he sort of drags himself through certain shots  his pants fit poorly  his tee shirt is coming untucked  his wavy dark hair  his most attractive feature  needs a good washing  and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee  nevertheless  he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two week train ride around europe  so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine  his oft cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine  although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation  when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence  we know he is getting somewhere after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes  bars  and silly diversions  they agree that because they may never see one another again  they should make the most of it  jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass  looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up given his boundless luck in the romance department  it is especially irksome when jessie  as the very definition of a naive jerk  foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp  he contents himself with a half baked plan  quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu  to reunite at the same spot in half a year  when the appointed time comes  you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another  perhaps even married and pregnant  for whatever reason  she probably won t show  while jesse  who ends up working at target or  if he s lucky  the local library  will go back to vienna  desperate to see her again  only to wind up alone despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion   before sunrise  is a beautiful movie  i highly recommend both it and the sequel   before sunset',1

'when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in      via a free advanced screening  i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it  i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended  i  on the other hand  felt completely the opposite  i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else  people i talked to said there was too much talking  plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters  i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie going public seems to have a tendency to want easy to follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused  they also like to be spoon fed tidy endings  happy or sad  this disgusts me  nobody wants to be challenged anymore    and as for the ending  and i don t want to be a spoiler   i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again  it s all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny  it s a very personal film that doesn t speak to all people  but it certainly spoke to me  give it a chance  be patient with it  richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna  watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters  as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass  it s very intimate  plus  ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life  they must have improvised during some parts and it works well  they have a great chemistry in their roles  their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses  i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr  linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made  it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much  bravo for romance',1

'ever since i can remember and i m only    my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run  but hey don t get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the   s and   s  anyways  now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv  of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson  but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed  the children   did not act like children in the slightest  but there is good reason for that  having had to hid and run most of your life  seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence  so people saying  oooo i hated how the kids acted   blah blah blah  read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see paul lukas   dear paul did an amazing job    now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didn t but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way  but lukas  performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears  i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone     d',1

'this movie is intelligent  that is  more than most other movies  it transcends the least common denominator   stupid people will probably not appreciate it  the story also relies heavily on dialogue  it has some parallels to lost in translation  although before sunrise is much brighter  somehow less abstract  and simply a lot better the script  the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic  the actors play absolutely brilliantly  rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together the dialogue moves into very personal issues  with the risk of becoming a little over the top  it does  however  stay on the right side almost all the time  although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing  balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors  sometimes  it yields great results  and overall this movie is simply stupendous  only very  very rarely is  love  in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic  every time that is achieved  the result is fantastic  i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect  she still looks stunning in this film     years after this is simply a gem of a movie that you can t miss  one of the best movies i have seen from the     s',1

'before sunrise has many remarkable things going on  almost too many to fit into one review like this  but it s suffice to say that it s one of the most observant character studies of the nineties  maybe even in all of contemporary cinema  to be observant not about love  per say  so much as it s about a human connection  how does one fall in love at first sight  no one does  at least that s deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film  and  yet  there is the possibility of as intense a connection  of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time  linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie  a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna  and on the way there start to talking about things  at first arbitrary  then personal  jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather   jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the  town   in vienna  until his plane the next morning before sunrise gives jessie and celine  in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance  and in a sense is about the act of having conversations  of what it s like to watch people having one leading into another and another  here it s often about relationships and commitments  as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential  or seemingly so  and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities  we hear confessions of desires for other loves  or what weren t really loves  of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you ll love your life  of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form  or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul  i loved the bit about the quakers in the church   and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism  jessie may be more responsible for that last part  but what s fascinating about the film is that it s never exactly cynical itself  just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives meanwhile  it s always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles  where they re not incessantly annoying in that   s generation x mode  but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film  which isn t a bad one at all but a necessary one  one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere  the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter  only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other  where sweet asides are actually acceptable   i have to tell you a secret   jessie says  and then leans in for a kiss  ho ho   or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way  i loved the scene with the poet  where it s very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal  or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share  but really are seeing them do it first hand  all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly  we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives  as it may lead off into the future   featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness  however self contained  as it may lead into something more  who s to say you can t suddenly be attached to someone  if only for less than    hours  and be that much more attached than a married couple  this is perhaps linklater s thesis  but there s more to it than just that  it s a very dense film  and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly  one scene especially  which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking  on the phone  in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other s friend  a',1

'this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i ve ever seen  closely followed by none other than  before sunset   which technically isn t another movie at all  since it s about the same two people and the same romance this is  love  in the real world  ok  that s only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie  reading the other reviews  it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog based movies as well  and this is what makes  before sunrise  so good  the dialog is perfect  it s so real  so engaging and funny  it s hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love   coz you fall in love with them at the very same time my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop  where they pretend to phone their best friends  with the other pretending to be said best friend  it s perfect  brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life i must say that if you have a choice  do watch  before sunrise  before watching  before sunset   if like me  you watched  sunset  first  it s hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show once again  the greatest romantic movie in my books  wonderful acting  excellent script  and beautiful locations  young love  at it s best',1

'richard linklater s beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the    s best thinking person s romantic movies  julie delpy turns in one of the decade s most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger on a train ethan hawke  the dialogue  and there is oodles of it  is sometimes meandering and overly precious  but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers making a romantic  intellectual  and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing  touching and insightful moments',1

'sweet and charming  funny and poignant  plot less but meaningful   before sunrise          the third movie of richard linklater  is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love  is in love  or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it  it is one of the very rare movies that is should will be equally interesting to teenagers  their parents and even grandparents  it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects  car chases  or long and steamy sex scenes  two young people in their early   s  two college students  american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne  meet on a train  they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking  they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night  they talk and fall in love  that s it  that s the movie  it could ve been boring and silly but instead  it is a lovely  believable  clever  and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing  at least  for this viewer   high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters  superb writing  always interesting and witty dialogs  two awesome performances  and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is  julie delpy  who looks like a botticelli s angel  is great in portraying smart  independent  and incredibly attractive young woman',1

'first let me say that before sunrise  like all movies  is not a movie for all tastes  it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact  but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people  for me  like most folks here  before sunrise struck a deep chord in me  i was truly stunned  moved  inspired by it  this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing  it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine  it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other  it is very intelligent and inspiring  not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celine s discussions  but rather the little nuances  the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other  it captures an honest  romantic  yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu  it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world  and what happens after that night is open for debate  but i never doubt that they won t each other again the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie see it and it may change your way of life',1

'i watched this movie    years ago  and have watched it on video an average of once a year since  it s the type of movie that s timeless  because the themes are universal  yet the stories and conversation are so personal  it s also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll  despite the fact that there are  really  just two  very involving  characters  this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy  who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine  this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv  and now  the phenomenon is rampant  i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space  and makes you think  however jaded you may be  that you are one of those characters  it also made me want to ride the train around europe  i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie  maybe that speaks about myself  my friends  or just the sheer genius of this movie',1

'there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime  but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives  these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don t meet these people anymore  we don t always even know their names  as we are never presented to each other  and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are  it s funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such  because reuniting might spoil fond memories  or we don t know do they  we are too afraid to check that out the movie  before sunrise  just caught me watching it  i never had intention to watch it through  but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting  i gave a look for the rest of the film  i didn t know what to expect from it  but nor did the young couple  they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate  i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through  it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives',1

'i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago  but its concept interested me when i heard it  an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking  it sparked my interest  but i never expected it to be this great  before sunrise is a masterpiece  and it s also one of the most romantic films on record  to my surprise  it completely lacked the cynicism of the     s  it s impossible to really talk too much about it  since there is no real plot  so to speak  although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about  it is sort of like my dinner with andre  where there is a conversation  but it s not just the conversation that matters   but let me just say  see it  see it',1

'many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with  the mortal storm  or  casablanca   everyone is entitled to compare films they choose  but the similarities of  the mortal storm  and  watch on the rhine  are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut  while the main comparative point brought out with  casablanca  is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in      by the academy of motion picture arts and science  because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar  it does not strike me as totally wrong  lukas had a good career in film  both here and in england   he is the villain in  the lady vanishes    and this performance was his best one  bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine  for instance  he was ignored for sam spade in  the maltese falcon  and roy earle in  high sierra  two years earlier  both of which were first rate performances  and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c  dobbs in  the treasure of sierra madres   the writer murder suspect in  in a lonely place   and captain philip francis queeg in  the caine mutiny  afterward   he got it for charley in  the african queen    i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs  but it did not happen  but lukas was lucky   he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career  few can claim that to me the film to look at with  watch on the rhine  is based on another play script by hellman   the searching wind   they both look at america s spirit of isolationism in the     s and     s   the searching wind  is really looking at the whole inter war period  while  watch on the rhine   set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii  deals with a few weeks of time  therefore it is better constructed as a play  and more meaningful for it s impact the film has many good performances  led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti nazi fighter courier  davis as his loyal wife  wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play s activities   coulouris as the selfish  conniving  but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck  lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald  as coulouris  wiser and sadder and fed up wife   and kurt katch  who delivers a devastating critique  as the local embassy s gestapo chief  about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis  it has dialog with bite in it  and what it says is quite true  it also has moments of near poetry  witness the scene  towards the end  when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis  and says   the new world has left the scene to the old world   hellman could write very well at times given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films',1

'it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other  ethan hawke  jesse   tape      and julie delpy  celine   er     tv series  nicole   this gal and guy  will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years  jesse and celine have great conversation  and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them  i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in      and if you have viewed this film  you will feel the same way',1

'before sunrise  is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top   favorite movies ever  dialog and acting are great  i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts  of course  the romantic vienna  introduced in the movie does not exist  you won t find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night  and it isn t possible to get to all the places in only one night  either  especially if you re a stranger and it s your first night in vienna   but that s not the point  the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic  although  nothing ever really happens  the movie never gets boring  the ending is genuinely sad without being  titanic  or something  even if you don t like love stories you should watch this film  i m a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer  the first part is perfect as it is  in my opinion',1

'i want cline and jessie go further in their relationship  i want to tell them that they were made for each other  that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other  their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached  this is about love but not stupid things like in  notting hills  or those kind of movie  this is life and i did believe in them  i did believe they were falling    this was so clever and touching  i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there    i want to go to vienna  i want to see them as soon as possible again i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake  a concept  but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere  somehow and some when  something could really happen i m french and didn t know very well july delpy despite kieslowski  three colors   white     now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting i saw  before sunset   the sequel in paris  a few days before i saw  before sunrise  and their is no matter  they are both masterpieces  proof that you don t need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings  i m sorry for my english which i m trying to best franck in france',1

'before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation  richard linklater s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people  the film depicts romance in all it s glory  but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples  and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to   with just one problem  the problem of time  while most relationships wind down with time  this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out  before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental  hollywood romance   which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders  the story follows two people  jesse  an american and celine  a french girl that meet on a train into vienna  they instantly connect  and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train  jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna   before sunrise works principally for two reasons   realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life  this allows the characters to be free  and it s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script  this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are  and not merely because they re the protagonists  this kind of realism is hard to capture as  at the end of the day  we as the audience know that they re watching a film and not observing real life  but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen  a truly great script cannot work on it s own  and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice  and although i m not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke  on viewing this film  there is nothing you can do but give them both respect  i don t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves  but when a film is this good  it hardly matters in a film like this  it is the writing that s the most important thing  and contained within the script are several observations about life  most of which i personally could relate to  this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters  but it also manages to expose what true love is  along with several other aspects of life  the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing  everyone is different  and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people  there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates  and that s the case with the musings in this script  adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna  the city itself isn t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere   but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat  energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating  richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema  a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental  before sunrise is what it is  and what it is  is pure cinematic brilliance',1

'this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy meets girl movies ever made  while  rebel without a cause  and  say anything  deliver nice portrayals  this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences  this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance  you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people  you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine  and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it  this movie is mostly all dialogue  based  but  every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing  what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is  how in all that conversation  while often having no real bearing on anything critical  you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other  this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone  and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe  this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random  and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place  it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests  and no matter how many times i watch this film  i don t think i will ever tire of that',1

'this movie is not about entertainment  or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time  this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god  one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie  we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie  there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed  god s love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal  there is the love in a marriage  while the main character grapples with his wife s disease  he realizes through god s love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine  he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated  finally  you have the love of child and parent  the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear  dear friends  love is not love unless it comes from god  because god is love and love comes from god  talk to someone and let them know you love them  love does no good unless it is given to another  i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it  amen',1

'forget the campy  religious  movies that have monopolized the television film market    this movie has a real feel to it  while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws  it also has that message of forgiveness  and overall good morals  however  i did not like the lighting in this movie    for a movie dealing with such subject matter  it was too bright  i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie  which is almost an unforgivable sin  but the recognizable cast  and their performances counteract this oversight definitely worth seeing    buy the dvd',1

'this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today  as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of alzheimer s or who are in the formative stages  i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease  the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle  casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line',1

'i wasn t expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you d expect to be living next door  they are ordinary flesh and blood people  not like the typical hollywood fare  they face an all too common problem  debilitating illness  but the story line grips the heart with a powerful lesson  casting  script  direction  and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story  give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire',1

'this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption  i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family  well acted and well directed  if there were any flaws  i d have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again  what about all people of all cultural backgrounds  i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown   like in real life  nevertheless  the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker  loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes',1

'a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie  it s based on a novel of the same title  which was equally good  though different from the film  really made you think about how you d respond if you were in the shoes of the characters  recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent  spouse  or family member  in other words  everyone though the production isn t quite hollywood quality  no big special effects  still  the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it  and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members  and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill you don t want to miss this',1

'when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas  its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film  yet  having read the content  i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie  the effect surprised me totally  i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me  a vow to cherish is  without any doubt  one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema  here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema first  the entire content is particularly educational  it has something to offer to the modern audience   pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions  is there a need for christ in our times  does love still matter  what for is there faith  what is the logics of burden and suffering in life  is there really someone by my side i can always trust  the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us second  the movie is exceptionally humane  the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions  is it better for kyle david denman  and teri  megan paul  to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home  is it better for john  ken howard  to leave ellen  barbara babcock   his sick wife  and start a new happy life with julia  donna bullock   a woman he falls in love with  in fact  ellen no longer recognizes him    yet  he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity  had john s rebellious brother  phil  d  david morin   better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life  phil s prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity  these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where  when or how they live third  the movie is a great portrayal of family  not very popular nowadays  there are problems  yet  there is always something more powerful that gets these people together  this  something  is love and trust  i know that it may seem a bit idealistic  not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that  nevertheless  it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one fourth  the entire film focuses on people s mutual help  if we want to live happy lives in our society  we must understand one thing  we have to help one another  alexander  ossie davis  is an example of such attitude  at the beginning of the movie  we see him talk to john about praying  later  he helps his brother  alexander is a kinda  angel  that is sent to john and his family  isn t it possible that we may become angels to one another fifth  the artistic features are also worth attention  performances  barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role  she does a perfect job  consider  for instance  the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again  ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband  picture  the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves  autumn  while the sunshine  love  spreads everywhere  i interpreted as a sort of symbol  even if there is sorrow  this can always be illuminated by light and joy   a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love  what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe  at the end  i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also dokyle to his uncle phil  yes  he  john brighton  lives according to the bible  but nobody forces you to do so  yet  according to what rules do you live',1

'even this early in his career  capra was quite accomplished with his camera work and his timing  this is a thin story    and quite predictable at times    but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately  the first part looks like a cinderella story  though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that    the rich  prince  will lose his fortune nonetheless  because of his good cast and fast pace  it s easy to get caught up in the clichs  then the movie does become more original  as the married couple have to find a way to make a living  the ending is very predictable but satisfying  i also want to compliment the title writing  very witty and fun',1

'i ll tell you a tale of the summer of       a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie  and it was a who s who of the top canadian bands of the age  we got there about  am  waited in line most of the morning  and when the doors opened at  am  we were among the first inside the gates  we then waited and waited in the hot sun  slowly broiling but we didn t care  because the headliners were among our favourites  at one point  early in the afternoon  i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier  i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t shirt  this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day  there s nothing reasonable  nor taste determined  nor really anything except their fandom  snotty of me  isn t it  so  i  in my hatred of the band  have denied myself the delight that is whale music desmond howl had it all  it s hard to say what he s lost  since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains  the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking   the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams  phantoms  and his own past  until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in   and  trite as it sounds  breaks him out canadian cinema suffers from several problems  generally  a lack of money  as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help  as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian  leads to lower production values than american or british films  and most people don t like to watch anything that sounds or looks like  well  not like an american film  next  canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story  and tell it well  third  they seem to think that gratuitous nudity  often full frontal  makes something artistic  i m sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies  especially late at night on the cbc  knows exactly what i m talking about  it s almost like a  don t do this  handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film makers threw it out a long time ago in the   s and   s  however  some films  such as bruce mcdonald s work and the brilliant c r a z y   have broken this mold  and managed to maintain what makes them canadian  while holding onto watchable production values and great stories  whale music is such a film  on the surface  deeper than just its canadian isms  it s a deeply moving story of a man who s lost his grip  through grief and excess  who is redeemed by music then by love  and that redeems even the rheostatics',1

'i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy  i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business   who are now still trying to become adults    no more fans groupies money etc   and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life   as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight   it is almost like they have to begin anew   this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the    s and    s are going through now    and that s where i find the film sad and depressing but it portrays the life of an old rock star abandoned and lost in a believable way the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren  outrageous    and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for  this film is a must have for folks in their    s who have seen the rise and fall of bands people who knew the members  and have watched them hurt as age creeps in and popularity fades this is an almost perfect movie    sad but in a way positive    because of the whales  a must see',1

'i was amazingly impressed by this movie  it contained fundamental elements of depression  grief  loneliness  despair  hope  dreams and companionship  it wasn t merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music  he finds a companion who comes with her own issues  claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star  yet he has musical genius  he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate  while things around him literally go to ruins  his focus is creating his whale music  in fact it becomes an obsession for him claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay  she finds hidden talents while being in des company  she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her  she learns to trust him over a period of time these two find love with one another  not the mind blowing  sex infused kind of passion  but a love where friendship and understanding means more  for two people who have been hurt  they find trust together',1

'a friend of mine recommended this movie  citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl  the movie s main character  i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more  i m not very sure whether or not that s flattering portrayal this is a pretty unique work  the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance  not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue  whale music is just so much more  well  relaxed   but instead that they both represent modern love stories in general i m a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians  for example i highly recommend hard core logo  and this film in particular  it has an innocent charm  des is not always the most likeably guy  but there s something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy',1

'my first exposure to  whale music  was the rheostatics album of the same name  that i bought around       i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album  which remains in a prominent place in my collection  was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington s book i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it  an amazing read  i have since re read the book numerous times  each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music i found the film in       on video  i haven t had a lot of good experiences with canadian film  but this one worked for me  the role of claire could have been cast differently  but overall i think that paul quarrington s vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius  the movie deals with family relationships  love  and finding someone who understands  i would strongly recommend  whale music  to not only music fans  but anyone who has ever lost something or someone  and tried to find their way back to the world',1

'walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema  how do you get laughs out of other people s misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long well  this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs  beautiful scenery  and quite a good buzz as well  i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it  and marijuana illegal  since  those other races  used it   undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world an extraordinary  dvd extra  commentary   two of them in fact   run thru the whole movie with both the actors  and then again with the writers  i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie  but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take  what a hoot  don t miss it       stars',1

'this is definitely a  must see  for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide out  trying to avoid being caught by parents  teachers  the police  etc    the protagonist is a lady in her forties  living in her mansion  breeding orchids  and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her  when he all of the sudden dies  she is confronted with the truth  the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt  she doesn t know what to do  until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain  she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead    the story is quite original  the performances outstanding  i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one  still  the melodramatic touch is present  the film is typical british  the jokes aren t vulgar  there is no violence involved  it shouldn t be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching  saving grace   it will be so much more fun  especially the scene with the   old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious  i thought my jawbones would burst',1

'this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist  and am i glad he did  the blend of british humor  should i say  humour   and the reality of a lost  middle aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot  add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot  those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received   and it is a truly hilarious  yet touching film  i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights  maybe it s just my mendocino county blood  but the brits definitely got this one right',1

'it may  or may not  be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca        role for the best actor oscar   i still would have given the oscar to bogie  but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination  at least   well  i m glad i did check this movie out  because i enjoyed it immensely  i think the movie did preach a little  but not only did i not mind  i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them the acting was outstanding in this movie  i especially enjoyed paul lukas  lucile watson  rightfully nominated for an oscar   bette davis  wrongfully not nominated   george coulouris and  oddly  eric roberts  who plays the middle child  i really enjoyed his character  an odd looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher  he just cracks me up  even the characters name  bodo  is funny the ending  in which lukas s character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons  worked for me as well  i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did  and i understood why he couldn t quite explain it  the message this movie makes is a good and noble one  the scenery  meaning the house  is beautiful  and the acting is the excellent  watch this movie if you ever get a chance',1

'this is an hilarious movie  one of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor  from the largest role to the smallest  each character is vivid  unforgettable and so understandable  it can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve',1

'a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother   saving grace  seems cut from the same cloth as a half dozen other british comedies over the past two years   underdog is faced with adversity  finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him herself in the process widowed and thus broke  grace is a master gardener  and is enlisted to help her friend employee matthew grow his pot plant  he s been doing it all wrong  so grace helps him out  they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot  which they can both benefit from  he enjoys smoking  she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise  dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in  saturday night fever  and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb blethyn is always watchable  and you can t say that about a lot of people  well  i can t  anyway  ferguson is very good  and tcheky karyo  who i liked in  la femme nikita   is memorable not profoundly moving or insightful  but immensely entertaining  and at a brisk    minutes  feels like a walk with friends',1

'i love this film  it s one of those i can watch again and again  it is acted well by a good cast that doesn t try too hard to be star studded the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller  either would have killed the film completely the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel good factor throughout it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes     no that s not a spoiler',1

'yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award material  but then it doesn t try to be anything it is not  a fun filled romp with real funny one liners  a stellar and very funny performance by peter o toole  a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright  the band s performance was on the spot  each one playing their role in a deft  comical manner  the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely  from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads  a good example is the comment about the  strange baseball like game   well my dear american  that was cricket  from which baseball is derived  and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket  also no  you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window  it was funny how lord foxley said  oh yes   to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time  oh no  also referring to the money  jeez  it seems that every joke must be explained to some people    all in all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs  well worth seeing',1

'charming doesn t even begin to describe  saving grace   it s absolutely irresistible  anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high  haha  grace trevethyn  brenda blethyn  has just lost her husband  but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse  her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts  faced with losing everything  she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash   fast  she gets an idea when her gardener  matthew  craig ferguson  asks the town famous horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing  grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana  so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of top quality weed  and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts the most notable quality about  saving grace  is its likability  every character is extremely sympathetic  and  save for the first    or so minutes  the film is non stop good cheer  everyone wants a happy ending for everyone  even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities the acting is top notch  brenda blethyn is one of britain s finest actresses  and here is why  she turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual  she s a nice lady  but she s not stupid  craig ferguson is equally amiable as matthew  he s a deadbeat loser  but he s so likable that it doesn t matter  the rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well  but special mention has to go to tcheky karyo  the french actor always has a aura of menace about him  and that suits him well  but he also has great comedy skills nigel cole finds the perfect tone for  saving grace   it s all about the charm  one of the problems i have with british humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the film  not so here  the film is thoroughly likable and always amusing  that s not to say that  saving grace  is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling  while this movie is not an out and out comedy  it does boast two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical if there s any problem with the film  it s that the climax is a little confusing  the questions are answered though  and the ending boasts an unexpected twist see  saving grace   especially when you re having a bad day',1

'i saw it last night on tv  and was quite delighted it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart  and believe that there is still some goodness in the world  all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her  the old policeman is my favourite   although you know that this story is not quite realistic i loved acting  they all seemed just as ordinary  common people  living in small picturesque english coast town  but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has  just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their  tea   perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing  but it didn t stop me from really  really enjoying the whole story',1

'after her oscar nominated turn in  secrets   lies   brenda blethyn starred in the equally great  saving grace   and let me tell you  this is not the sort of movie that you find every day after her husband commits suicide  grace trevethyn  brenda blethyn  discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt  fortunately  she finds a way to make ends meet  marijuana  that s right  grace starts cultivating it every aspect of this movie was played to great effect  there isn t a dull moment anywhere in it  and i sure didn t see that end scene coming  but anyway  you gotta see this movie  you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it  if nothing else  it might function as a good lesson about knowing one s finances  but of course  there s a lot more to it than that',1

'this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value  it gets quite hysterically funny at times  but if you haven t spent any time on  that  side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles  how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played  she s a true lady  and  my favorite is grace s white pimp suit that she wears i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud  who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different',1

'for muslim women in western africa  married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard   the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour  but equally  they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal  an attitude which of course enables it to continue  fortunately  the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all  and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children  what is notable  apart from the uplifting central story  is how  in spite of their informality  the courts are actually pragmatically progressive  if a case is actually bought  the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life style  which  aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases  seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america  and while i concede that this comment may betray naivet on my part  this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin english they speak  overall  this is a terrific little film  and much more fun to watch than you might imagine',1

'i saw saving grace right after it came out on video  since then it s become one of my favorites  the plot isn t particularly complex but it doesn t take away from the entertainment  it s chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it  the characters are what makes the movie so good  they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor  the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind  superb acting was done by all  particularly brenda blythen  she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments  if you re looking for a good comedy i d definately recommend this movie',1

'this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam  whether financially or emotionally  you will definitely laugh  which is the best medicine     left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies  grace has to find a new way to make some money and it s not exactly legal which adds to the humour  even my boyfriend liked it so don t think that it s a chick flic',1

'excellent view of a mature woman  that is going to lose everything  even the pruner has a mortgage   the way she gets involved into this special  business   the innocence  and the true love that exists between the people of a little town  it s mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh  light and funny comedy  i couldn t stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore i love european films  and with movies like this one  my opinion grows stronger  a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed  in this same genre  is waking ned devine saving grace  a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself  you will love it',1

'great actors  an oscar nominee actress  stunning scenery  good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag  and thats quite big   this film was brilliant  it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were    well  side splitting  i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much  and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the  stoned ladies in the tea shop  scene  well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year  if not of all time',1

'i just thought it was excellent and i still do  i m grateful we re still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with  saving grace is smart and enjoyable   those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the america s bride sort of movie saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesn t have to be stupid  i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband s debts in a nutshell   a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing  you couldn t ask for more',1

'it s a bit easy  that s about it the graphics are clean and realistic  except for the fact that some of the fences are  d  but that s forgiveable  the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n   games  the sounds are magnificant  everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times  but it s the same for every platform game  like banjo kazooie and donkey kong    i got this game as a christmas present in       and since then  i have dutifully gotten     stars over    times',1

'mario s first foray into the world of   dimensions is incredible  miyamoto s masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo    when it was released in      and it still holds all of it s charm today  this game is an instant classic that set the standard for  d adventure platform games',1

'this movie had an interesting cast  it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job  im glad we have b grade movies like this one  the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it  you don t need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot  i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn t close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station  arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation  this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future',1

'although super mario    isn t like the rest of the games in the series  it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games  games with this much replay value are few and far between  plus  this game has so much variety  there are    levels each with several different tasks you can do  and many other hidden tasks  the game isn t very challenging  but its lack of challenge doesn t take away from the game at all  once you beat it  you ll want to erase your game and start again  and its just as much fun the second time  or third time  or two hundredth time  a must own for any nintendo    owner  and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo',1

'super mario    is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created  it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break  i ve beaten the game   times  but i ve never gotten all     stars    i ve gotten        but i hope to achieve them eventually  even though i didn t officially play this game until i was seven in  i loved watching my sisters play it  now i am    and still play this  erasing games and starting over again the graphics are unbelievable for an early n   game  the gameplay is addictive  the controls are great  the levels are tough  but not impossible  the bowser fights are challenging i would like to tell you more  but why don t you just get it for yourself  put the x box      ps   and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo    and play this amazing  wonderful game',1

'one of the funnest mario s i ve ever played  the levels are creative  there are fluid controls  and good graphics for its time  there s also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight  sometimes the levels get frustrating  and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still  need to get more accomplished to fight a boss  it can be annoying  another complaint is the camera angle  though it works fairly well most of the time  it can be a pain in certain situations  if your a big time mario fan  this ones for you  even if your not a huge fan of him  i d still recommend this one  its a big game  and getting what you need can take a while  but it s very satisfying  good for playing in short bursts of time  it will almost certainly hold your interest  it sure does hold mine',1

'when i first got my n   when i was five or six i fell in love with it and my first game was super mario    and i loved it the graphics were great for it s time a good plot great courses and above all the best music i heard in a nintendo game i don t remember the plot completely but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser and mario has to rescue her the object of the game is to get     stars from the curses in the castle each had about five or six challnges to get the stars there are secert parts of the castle where you can get more stars but of course you have beat bowser  i think there are three levels to beat bowser on  lets start with the characters mario is the main character and gets helpful advice from toad so he is basically one of your only alliances i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end the main villain is bowser and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba the characters are really great next how about the graphics people say gameplay is more important then the graphics and i agree completely but with he great plot there are great graphics especially for it s time i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like     and their graphics don t compare to super mario bright colors great effects and awesome sound effects i found the graphics in the water courses very very good next to the bowser world ones it has the best graphics in the game now the music this is my favorite part of the game growing up when i played this at a young age i d gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep especially the music from jolly roger bay which was peaceful and wonderful there are others that are great too especially in once again the worlds with bowser are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer and i love it this game gets       or                   go play the game',1

'or at least one of the best  i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n    bowser is up to his usual shenanigans  yeah it s a dumb word but the only one i can think of  and mario must stop him again  this game is very fun to play  and contains lots of nostalgia to me  the only bad thing about it is the graphics  which are awful to today s standards  but everything else is pretty good  especially the little mini games you can unlock  it s the second best n   game  the first best is conker s bad fur day  that i recommend to any mario fan  or any fan of platform games  it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day      or  a',1

'yes  that s right  it is  i firmly believe that the n   and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made  it was amazing the first time i saw it  with its huge environments and colorful characters  and its amazing now  the play control is perfect  the graphics are beautiful  and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there  a must have for any n   owner  and a reason to get an n   for everyone else',1

'rated ei never actually owned a nintendo    but i have played one many times in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day  super mario    is one of the best video games for the nintendo    system i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time if you have an n   and don t have this game you should try to find it the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario    has a  d mario in a nice  d environment the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the     power stars from bowzer now you can do it in a  d environment super mario    is a very fun and good n   game and i recommend it',1

'this game is amazing  really  you should get it if you don t have it  although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out  i believe that this game will always be a classic  it s just as good a super mario world or so  when i was young  my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did  it s not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy  but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential  it s fun entertaining and challenging  everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics   well it did come out in        rock on  eva mario luigi and yoshi    nintendo is the best',1

'mario is invited to princess peach s castle for cake  when mario gets there  he finds out that bowser has kidnapped her  mario must save the day again  unlike the   d games  mario can explore anything he wants to  he can just roam around  climb trees trying to look for   ups  find secrets in levels  and more  you can spend four hours in one level  no time limits  there are    worlds  with a number of stages  and there are star doors  which you need a certain number of stars to get into  once you get in these star doors  you must go through a stage and fight bowser at the end of the stage  to get to certain worlds  you need a number of stars to get in  you enter the world by going through a painting  there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay  i don t see how anyone could dislike this game  it s great  this launch title is the game that insured gamers that the n   would have a good life  every  d plat form game we know of has something in common with sm    banjo kazooie and banjo tooie are examples that are commonly used  super mario    is one of the greatest games in the history of  d games     out of     if you have an n    buy this game  it s hard to find used  because no one s selling this baby for   bucks at the pawn shop  a perfect',1

'first i bough this movie on vhs than i just had to buy it on dvd  it is on of my favorite movies of all time  i have read the book  but i really think the movie is much better  i loved gwyneth paltrow as emma and jeremy northam as mr  knightley was an excellent chose  he was brilliant it s a       movie',1

'emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel  i have not read the book so i really didn t know that much about the plot  and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot  there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing  the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it  of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny  gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma  the film also stars toni collette who has okay but has been much better  ewan mecgreger who has also been better but he is still very good here  alan cumming who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here  and jeremy northam who s performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle  even if that was not what it needed  there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching',1

'a slight  charming little movie to be sure  but a superbly crafted one  gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent  and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue  this came out around the time of sense and sensibility  and i m sure i don t know why that one garnered all the oscar attention  emma is jane austen s most accessible and least stuffy story  told well',1

'lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen s satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial   th century england  northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other  good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material  which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism   i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up  and i thought it didn t rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the   s and   s do  very good results',1

'wrapped in gorgeous english country backgrounds  emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways emma  gwyneth paltrow  is a graceful  intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess  and confidant  to a marriage which emma takes the credit in matchmaking  eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her  she decides to match the vicar  mr  elton  alan cummings  with her pretty young friend  harriet  toni collette  the result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out  with emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought the film is full of jane austen s witty and wry characterizations  gwyneth paltrow is at her best  portraying this maiden of a restrained  polite society with wit and ease  her growing romance with the unparalleled mr  knightley  jeremy northam  is the heart of this film  mr  knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films  he is incredibly handsome  in a modest  relaxed way that is irresistible  he is certainly well matched to gwyneth paltrow  their charming friendship that began when he was    and she was an infant  has blossomed as he  a family friend  matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more  with a wry look or understated jab at emma  northam s knightley is a delight to watch other wonderful characterizations include the comic juliet stevenson  greta scacchi  ewan mcgregor  polly walker  and the talkative spinster  miss bates  who is very funny seeming shorter and more flowing than most jane austin adaptations  emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment',1

'i m a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature length film  a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini series  it was really great  gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr  knightly with his poise and nobility  i wasn t thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didn t feel it spoiled the movie at all  like i said  as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren t but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well  i ve seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one',1

'this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon  the  sisters  in law are female lawyers and judges who in      successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council  it is rather long    about two hours    but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges  it will leave you  as it left me  with many questions about exactly how this change occurred  how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon  have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses  was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court  against the express wishes of the husband  a one time event  i m not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions  they made the movie two years ago  not yesterday  and the movie they made deserves a wide audience',1

'i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels  well  this transposition is simply accurate  intelligent  delicate  careful  tactful  respectful  intense  in a word  perfect  emma  is one of austen s most delightful and funny novels  thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters  the movie respected this subtle irony  not disregarding the comic element  miss bates above all   what engaged me in the novel  and the movie renders it clearly  is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist  and the modern look with which women  men  and their relation are handled  and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the   th century  who lived almost a secluded life  could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did  that most and still fascinates me  we can feel this modernity throughout the movie  just replace costumes  and use a more current language but the situations  the feelings  the ideas would be extremely modern  i think of the morbid interest in other people s lives  or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women s relations  and still the difficulty in revealing  and giving expression to one s feelings  especially love  every situation gets a universal and out of time value the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances  a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role  nowadays she would be probably too mature for it   toni colette is simply great  and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear  and then  the breathtaking english countryside  where every situation gets such a magic and dream like dimension    a really enjoyable and deserving movie',1

'well  i guess i m emotionally attached to this movie since it s the first one i went to see more than    times in the cinema     helping me through my master s thesis  or rather keeping me from working on it but on watching it again several years  and many many movies  later   what a well crafted little gem this is  i ve never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance  and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley   where does one meet such a man         sophie thompson s turn as ms bates is virtuoso acting of the finest  oh  napkins  sorry   and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either   toni colette brings a lot of muriel to her harriet  and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming   and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect  impossible  couple of course the sets and costumes  and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood  almost hobbiton like atmosphere of the movie   although as far as cinematography and art decoration go  it s almost a case of visual overload  very very pretty  but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period  but the good thing is  the movie doesn t take itself too seriously  and there is plenty of fun   and some pretty cool editing   that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england mode my particular favorite is the ball scene   some beautiful acting and directing here  and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully  pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long   cut two shots  i can think of exactly which ones   and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the movie gosh  i just realize  by reading the imdb listings  that i ve seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him   seems he s got a lot more going for him  as an actor  than just being a gentlemanlike english heartthrob  hmm  guess i need to pay my video store a visit   lovely movie  my favorite jane austen adaptation so far   though perhaps ang lee s sense and sensibility is  strictly speaking  the better movie  this one is closest to my heart   and i ve certainly seen it many more times  watch it if you can   and don t be too hard on its little imperfections',1

'emma is a true romance  if you love the soppy stuff  charged with wit and folly  you will love this movie  its true to the novel  which is very important  with a few twists added for pleasure  gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades  she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to jeremy northam  as the hero  how shocked are you  i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck  what the right role can do for you  he looks so good as the sensible  regal mr  k  that i am literally looking at him in a new light  he makes and excellent romantic lead  the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful ewan mcgregor  greta sacchi brings in the rest  a good cast  a good movie  if you are a fan of jane austen  see this movie  along with pride and prejudice   and most importantly  buy the books  it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary',1

'jane austen would definitely approve of this one gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma  she is funny without being excessively silly  yet elegant  she puts on a very convincing british accent  not being british myself  maybe i m not the best judge  but she fooled me   she was also excellent in  sliding doors    i sometimes forget she s american     also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law  emma thompson s sister and mother  as the bates women  they nearly steal the show   and ms  law doesn t even have any lines highly recommended',1

'i have no idea how a texan  the director  douglas mcgrath  and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms  paltrow was in the first place  i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar winning  shakespeare in love  performance but she gets all the beats right here  she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse  she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this of course  she s surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette  greta scacchi  juliette stevenson et al   jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest  even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow  in the process  allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship   several years on  ewan s hair is a little easier to take than it was in     and  personally  i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays  but the standout is  without a doubt  sophie thompson  sister of emma thompson  daughter of phyllida law  as miss bates  what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates  as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn  the film is worth watching  again even  for her performance alone all in all  this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system  well worth a rental  because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again  but we ll always have emma',1

'romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england  in this light hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue  the ladies were charming and elegant  and the gentlemen dashing   emma   based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath  stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role  a self appointed matchmaker  emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another  coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage  she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend  harriet  toni collette   but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying  meanwhile  her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr  knightley  jeremy northam   whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma s  and lend some needed balance to the proceedings  and emma  so concerned with what is right for others  neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all  her own  the world goes round and love abounds  but emma is about to miss the boat  luckily for her  however  the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings  now  if she can but stop long enough to realize it  but as everyone who has known true love knows  matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant  depending upon the slightest thing  and while romance is at hand for emma  she must first recognize it  and seize the moment mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful  feel good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world  there may be an air of frivolity about it  but in retrospect  this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is   in all honesty   to just about anyone  love  and with mcgrath s impeccable sense of pace and timing  it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable  it s a pleasant  affecting film  with a wonderful cast  that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place  it s light fare  but absorbing  and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow the winsome paltrow  who won the oscar for best actress for  shakespeare in love  two years after making this one  seems comfortable and right at home in this genre  she personifies all things british  and does it with such naturalness and facility that it s the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether  she s simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy  she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner  very reminiscent of audrey hepburn  yet paltrow is unique  as an actor  she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated   with such films as  hard eight    hush  and  a perfect murder    that she can play just about any part effectively  and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own  but it s with characters like emma that she really shines  she is so expressive and open  and her personality is so engaging  that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch  regardless of the part she is playing  and for emma  she is absolutely perfect jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley  and like paltrow  seems suited to the genre   in the right role  that is  his performance in the more recent  the golden bowl   in which he played an italian prince  was less than satisfying  here  however  he is perfect  he is handsome  and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real  like colin firth s mr  darcy in the miniseries  pride and prejudice   northam has created a memorable character with his own mr  knightley also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette  as emma s friend harriet smith  and alan cumming  as the reverend elton  respectively  collette and cumming create characters who are very real people  and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film  and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema  and to films of any genre the supporting cast includes greta scacchi  mrs  weston   denys hawthorne  mr  woodhouse   sophie thompson  miss bates   kathleen byron  mrs  goddard   phyllida law  mrs  bates   polly walker  jane fairfax  and ewan mcgregor  frank churchill   an uplifting  elegant film   emma  is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness  and even if it s only through the magic of the silver screen  it s nice to be able to escape to such a world as this  if only for a couple of hours  as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit  and that s the magic of the movies  i rate this one',1

'this is one of the best films i have seen in years  i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan  but she is excellent as emma woodhouse  alan cumming is superb as reverand elton  and emma thompson s sister  sophie  is hysterical as miss bates  and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr  knightley  what a gentleman  whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma  i think that is what separates it from so many others  it s classy if you re looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family  or looking for a romance for yourself  look no further  emma is that movie  with a beautiful setting  wonderful costumes  and an outstanding cast  have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam    emma is a perfect ten',1

'i was so impressed with doug mcgrath s film version of the jane austen novel  emma   and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much  that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re united for  nicholas nickleby  i immediately rented it without any other consideration i have read the book  and for those overly critical fans of this jane austen adaptation  i don t know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen s work  especially given the limitations of a two hour movie  which some have complained about being too long    and as far as gwen paltrow s accent is concerned  i must confess i wasn t too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially  and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery  that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside  the film s beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success  if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker  then perhaps you should rent something like  death wish iii  the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast  and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings  mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex  violence or even a villainous antagonist  the story is often amusing  endearing  and at times  quite touching i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite',1

'by no means my favourite austen novel  and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress  but i found the film almost totally delightful  paltrow does a good job  and cummings  stevenson and the one who plays  miss bates  are all absolutely terrific  the period detail is not alienating  the feel of the movie is just right  in fact  but the real  find  is jeremy northam as mr knightley  there could not be more perfect casting  imo  i hated mr k in the novel  but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film  northam s good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment  either  highly recommended  anar',1

'a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association  wla  of kumba  in southwest cameroon  in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence  in this muslim culture  where men have always been sovereign over women  according to sharia law  one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children  after    years of failed efforts  leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins  and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories the leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa  a state prosecutor  and beatrice ntuba  a senior judge  court president   both play themselves in this film  which may contain footage shot spontaneously  though i imagine much of it  if not all  consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera  four cases are reviewed  and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film two cases involve repeated wife beating  with forcible sex in one case  another involves forced sex upon a    year old girl  and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child  age    by an aunt  one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce  we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials  the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children  the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and or fines  the divorce is granted the aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender neutral when it comes to enforcing the law  also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties  including those found guilty  are treated  this is a highly important and well made film   of interest is the fact that one of the directors  ms  longinotto  also co directed the      film  divorce  iranian style  which dealt with related themes in tehran    in broken english with english subtitles   my grade  b',1

'what a delightful film   accompanied by oscar winning composer rachel portman s lush  emotional and dreamy music  this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year incredible casting   gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma  toni collette was great as harriett smith the character who stole the film was miss bates    she was mesmerizing to watch  one finds oneself on the edge of ones  seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her  one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages  from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr  woodhouse for sending  that lovely quarter hind of pork    pork  mother     she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother  mrs  bates  played by emma thompson s mother  phyllida law  who looks forlorn and lost the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart  we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one s heart ripped out to her on her behalf  it is a classic scene  one to be rewound and played over   over   the ending is right up there with  sense   sensibility  and provides one of life s greatest lessons about how one should marry one s best friend   i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself i adored it',1

'make the world go away  get it off my shoulder  say the things you used to say  and make the world go away well  dave  david hewlett  and andrew  andrew miller  were in a pickle  one for embezzlement  and the other for kissing a child  neither was guilty  but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down  they ended up in  well  nothing  the whole world  except for their house went away it is kind of weird  but funny  too  just what would you do if you were all alone in the world  the two friends just enjoy each other s company  and do what they want  but  that gets old fast  it seems then they start to improve their live by hating away memories  the sound effects during this were great things really got weird at the end  this film was the product of a great imagination  and written and directed by vincenzo natali  with help from the two stars  it just has to be seen',1

'i totally agree that  nothing  is a fantastic film  i ve not laughed so much when watching a film for ages  and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this  they really work well together  this film may not appeal to some people  i can t really say why without spoiling it   but each to their own  i loved it and highly recommend it the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever  it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it although there are really only main   characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch',1

'yes   i m going with the     on this and here s why  in the last few years  i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget  then i stumble upon  nothing   looked interesting  wasn t expecting much though  i was wrong  this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch  dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember  but not over complex to the point of missing the joke  i don t want to remark on any of the actual scenes  because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once  with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies  you know  like killer military jets and  fresh  remakes that are ruining old classics   this movie will make you happy to say it s ok to laugh at  nothing',1

'sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating  divorce  iranian style  which was as exactly as it stated  as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran  now they ve turned their attention to the court system in cameroon  africa  what s great about this court is that   of the magistrates are women  which is unusual for such a country like this  anyways  they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women  but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society  with divorce legal and women s rights being recognized  so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times  not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment  one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt  the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury  and who said that justice isn t served anymore  with these   behind the bench  they often carry out maximum penalties  ya  you go girl',1

'i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience  the imagination on display  the visual interpretation of the script  the humor is constantly surprising  the two leads are great and really carry the film  my advice would be to not even watch a trailer  just rent the film and watch without expectations  i rented from blockbuster  so it is readily available in brisbane  not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that s always good  unless it s just  that was stupid   i loved this film  you just don t get to see gem s like this every day  this should become a cult favorite  give it a try  you may just feel the same way about it as i do',1

'a light hearted comedy  nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to  a world of nothing  anything you don t like  be it a stack of bills  a bad memory  or even hunger can disappear at your wish  they approached this movie very well  and with an enjoyable starring duo  there were only a few things i didn t like about nothing  and they weren t even part of the main movie first  the post credits scene  and yes  there is one   good for a chuckle  but what were they trying to accomplish with that  i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing  instead  we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream  it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion  and wasn t really necessary  nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame second  the trailer  i saw the trailer on the dvd  and like others have already said this  it promotes a horror movie that never came  oh well  poor marketing i guess if you see this at your movie rental store  take a look  because nothing is a great movie to watch  if you have a big screen though  you might want to wear shades',1

'well   cube          vincenzo s first movie  was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that i ve ever seen when talking about movies  they had just one scenery  a bunch of actors and a plot  so  what made it so special were all the effective direction  great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth  his second movie   cypher          was all about its story  but it wasn t so good as  cube  but here are the characters being tested like rats again  nothing  is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his  cube days   locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room  but instead of a thriller sci fi  even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that    nothing  is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we re living  once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing    actors and a blinding white scenario  that s all you got most part of time and you don t need more than that  while  cube  is a claustrophobic experience and  cypher  confusing   nothing  is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget  of course that the movie fails sometimes  but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws  there s nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since  cube',1

'i chanced upon this movie because i had a free non new release from blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly  as the store was getting ready to close for the evening  the plain white cover and title intrigued me  i m a  relatively speaking   old  lady and my son is a young man of     i adore movies that are sheer entertainment  such as the sixth sense  interview with a vampire  harry potter and beetlejuice  my son  on the other hand  is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films  such as those directed by bergman or hertzog  we generally hate each other s movie choices  however  we both watched and loved the movie nothing  it was unlike any movie we d ever seen before  we re both cynical critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them    but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish  it is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the u s  it would have done very well indeed',1

'i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film  and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed  it made much of the fact that the film was  by the director of cube  and made it look like a horror film  when in fact it is an absurdist comedy  imdb s spell checker doesn t seem to think that absurdist is a word  but it is   reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead i love the way the story builds up slowly at first  then gradually escalates  i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film  that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube  i recommend it',1

'i just saw this at the toronto film festival  and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again  it is a character driven film  and andrew and david are more than up to the task  any discussion of the plot might beconsidered spoilers  so i ll just say that the storyline is clever  the acting is superb  and the effects are amazing  well filmed and well paced too  one of the best films i have seen in ages  and very refreshing in this summer of drearymovies  it had the audience laughing the whole time  see it if you can   i particularly liked the  candy bar  candy bar   scene',1

'if you want mindless action  hot chicks and a post apocalyptic view of seattle  then this is the show for you the concept of dark angel isn t anything new  in fact  there s controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book   but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finish jessica alba is smoking and max  friends  original cindy  kendra  are just as hot the fight scenes are getting better  but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better  the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it  in my opinion  dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for  but if you re looking for hard hitting  award winning drama  go watch  the west wing  or something',1

'i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk  well actually  it doesn t  because this film is everything a hollywood film isn t   original  creative  quirky and humorous  it seems that today no one really wants to see this type of movie as  in the simplest terms  it doesn t conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film i haven t written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention  even if it is during my    minute break between classes  essentially  it is about nothing  as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world  the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise en scene consists of half a house and a vast white  empty space  this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors  both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles i d love to write some more but am on quite a time limit  however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try  a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well executed fashion  with the combination of good performances  a strong script  nice sound design and  fairly  impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie it s just a shame so few people know about nothing',1

'nothing is fantastic  simple as that  it s a film that shouldn t work  yet does  natali stays in the realm of sci fi  however this film is also a comedy  cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali  at     million  woo hoo pa   so with nothing he scales down again  this is low budget  independent film making at it s best  simple  good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywood s usual reasons for mostly financial gain  nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask  no it is not anything like seinfeld  basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers  they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways  andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out  dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with  by bizarre mis fortunes however  dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves work place incriminating dave  and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout  canadian humour people    as it turns out andrew s house is to be demolished as well and he can t stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on  both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling  they are desperate and can t escape  and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white  what has happened  have dave and andrew died  they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet  no police  no demolition team  no angry girl scout mother  what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to  wish or hate away   as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world  they are left alone  the house is surrounded by nothing  which is portrayed as pure white  so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white  the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water  they begin to tire of each other  they discover they can hate away hunger  which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say  i can t reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold this film is quirky  funny  interesting  the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube  david hewlett  and andrew millar to lead the film  they have chemistry and also work very well  they have to hold     of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background  yet it works  certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states  nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comers natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature  i prey to god he doesn t do the proposed necropolis  written and directed by add sufferer  the ever crap paul anderson  vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad  run    run like the wind   i hope and prey this guy doesn t take to hollywood like alex proyas did  with the enjoyable yet pussy footed  sugar coated  helium light  i robot    keep your eyes peeled for this guy',1

'than this     what would happen if terry gilliam and douglas adams would have worked together on one movie  this movie starts with a touch of brazil    when  at a certain point  the story moves straight into the twilight zone    bringing up nothing new  but just nothing    and nothing is great fun  when dave and andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable    bouncing heads  well    yes    anyway    this movie was  imho  the biggest surprise at this year s fantasyfilmfest   just like in cube and cypher natali gave this one a minimalistic  weird but very special design  which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time    timeless somehow',1

'the premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now  we ve all heard or read about it in some kind of con text  what would you do if you were all alone in the world  what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes  in fact  the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew  two room mates living in a run down house in the middle of a freeway system  andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society  that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along  because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed  just until   straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them  both of them get involved with crime  andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn t dare going out of the house  dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues don t treat him very well and with the respect he deserves  the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it  this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away    and of course that is exactly what happens the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness  at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment  but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left nothing features an incredibly small cast   in fact  besides the first couple of shots from the film  we only see dave  david hewlett  and andrew  andrew miller  in the entire film  it is clear that in order to pull this off  the cast has to be more than up for the task  because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way  vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well  director of photography  derek rogers  also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information  especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it  but we don t see it right away obviously  this can t be an event driven film and it s not  much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void  and that s where some of the most hilarious scenes take place  especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy bar now  one could be thinking   how does nothing look like   well  it looks like nothing indeed  the entire world of nothing is white    white no matter in what direction you look  this is the weakness of this film    after an hour or less it s getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it s more interesting to look at  thank god  there are some  for example at times when the two lads  due to the properties of nothing  are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of    tofu  as andrew claims   it s fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society one of the best parts of the film is the set    production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film  the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at  still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this  all in all  the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching   however  the very best part of the film is the acting  both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are  the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said  there are just about no props in the film  they are really on a bare stage  with plenty of character development and some decent one liners  clever dialogue  at times hilariously stupid   it all works to that end   and this really moves the movie away from the low budget area to well crafted handwork let s talk a little about the visual effects  because they are definitely worth mentioning  nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film  there s a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film  and although the drews have milked that scene completely it s still fun to watch  one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment   they have the abilities to wish everything away  so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear  nothing  is a bright and well lit movie  it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead  this is in fact one of their theories   but  nothing  is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory  we don t know where they are or what has happened to them  we don t know if they will ever get out  because the movie ends before we see anything like that  the ending  by the way  is not as good as it could ve been  it s rather easy to predict what is going to happen  still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end  it s a reasonably satisfactory one take  hollow man    kill bill    cube    epoch  and lots of other films and you have  nothing   it really is an amalgam of different styles  still there is no other film  at least that i know of  nothing is really like  for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube  he talks about him and andr bijelic having been room mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out   nothing  could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story  and to that end  it s almost like one of the cube prequels what can i say  i enjoyed  nothing   it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well made with tons of intelligent ideas  still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is    maybe if we have a  nothing    i can answer that question   nothing  is a great film  but not as good as i expected it to be final rating',1

'i wasn t sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this  a smart  slightly twisted comedy that makes you think  i wasn t quite sure how a director can create  nothing   but leave it to mr  natali and the brilliant individuals at c o r e  to create another low budget set that looks real  as real as nothing can be   well worth your time and money  if you have the opportunity to see this  please go  you ll be glad you did',1

'just saw this at the      vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal  takes place in toronto  where these two losers live in this run down house in the middle of a freeway system  david hewlett  pin  cube  cypher  and andrew miller  cube  are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away  the acting  dialogue and writing are very good  and the whole film looks great for such a low budget flick  director writer vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening  and he seemed so intelligent and down to earth  this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets  it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame',1

'charlie kauffman has made weird metaphysical angst popular  but this canadian gem makes it hilarious like most weird films the less said about plot the better but let s set the scene  two friends anthony and dave have been together since childhood  they can t cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to  but that is where even more problems begin i loved this film  it made me smile long after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many mass produced pieces of  nothing  out there don t miss this',1

'i haven t written a review on imdb for the longest time  however  i felt myself compelled to write this  when looking up this movie i found one particular review which urged people not to see this film  do not pay any attention to this ignorant person  nothing is a fantastic film  full of laughs and above all    imagination  aren t you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubble gum trash movies  sometimes a film like nothing comes along and gives you something you have never seen before  i don t even care if you dislike  even hate  the movie  but no one has a right to discredit the film  imdb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film like that  just say you hate it and why you hate it    but don t try to tell people that they shouldn t watch it  we have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank you if my judgment is any good  i d say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate it treat your mind to a bit of eye candy  see nothing',1

'all i have to say is if you don t like it then there is something wrong with you  plus jessica is just all kinds of hot      the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where seattle has gone to hell  that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen',1

'jimmy cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage producer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming  talking  movies this story of love  deceit  women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment  the direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done  the story never really got lost in this frantic pace some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn t matter because when you look at this in a      time frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time jimmy cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film  never loosing his composure as the ever working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros  in this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business  he was a broadway producer before he started this  joan blondell is fabulous as the neglected love interest  nan  she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time  so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change the only problem i had with the film were the enormous productions at the end  these were magnificent in itself  beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced  but they just didn t seem to fit in the story  the only link they have to the main story is that cagney had to put on   previews in   days to get a contract and that s what he did  i had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater  in this way the  sitting on a backyard fence  was much more appropriate to the story the productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing  i was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then i realized there were another two coming up  these sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well all in all a great film with a sour ending',1

'such energy and vitality  you just can t go wrong with busby berkley films and this certainly must be his best  of course the choreography is wonderful  but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight  don t miss this one',1

'the wit and pace and three show stopping busby berkley numbers put this ahead of the over rated   nd street  this is the definitive    s musical with a knockout frenetic performance from jimmy cagney  one of the last releases before the motion picture production code was strictly enforced  a must see',1

'in      dick powell and ruby keeler sang and danced their way through three warner brother musicals that offered depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes  gold diggers of         nd street and footlight parade were all set in the world of broadway theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on  in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley  show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it s pace energy and lead james cagney  warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in   nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads  particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash  both lack the infectious energy of cagney however  who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical  he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers  unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is  the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh  hugh herbert  guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size  busby berkeley s dance numbers are surreal  suggestive and risqu and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in     sadly  the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of footlight again  gentility and morality made sure of it',1

'never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely  dick powell   scott blair  who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler   bea thorn   james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater s during the      s  chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows  this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs  joan blondell   nan prescott  gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty  dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career  enjoy',1

'a wonder  one of the best musicals ever  the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular  but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non stop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell   keeler is also lovely  even though she may not have been a great actress   there s a freshness in the movie that you don t see in flicks today  much less in the usually stilted   s films  even though the plot  involving the setting up of movies prologues  is quite dated',1

'i loved this film  seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen  the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things  and the fast pace was most enjoyable i do  as a singer and musical director  question one section of roby keeler s vocal in  by a waterfall   the key modulated  and she was suddenly singing much lower  in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer  it sounds it to me  i would love to know thanks so much',1

'clever  gritty  witty  fast paced  sexy  extravagant  sleazy  erotic  heartfelt and corny  footlight parade is a first class entertainment  what the movies are all about the realistic  satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking  to think that they only started making feature talking pictures   years before this  the brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today  especially considering that  realism  has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema this film was made at a time when the hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh  self referential  critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age  i d recommend watching any film from this period  that is            for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be',1

'it s hard to say which comes out on top  james cagney s charm and energy or the mouth  opening excesses of busby berkeley s three grand showstoppers at the close  i give it a tie  with footlight parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early thirties musicals  although the movie clearly belongs to cagney  joan blondell adds immeasurably to the good natured story line and what s the story line  it s about chester kent  cagney  who produces musicals  and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over  he starts doing prologues  live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts  he gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them  moving them around the country  he s a ball of fire and ideas  and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things  but a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas  nan prescott  blondell   his wise cracking secretary  loves him but he s too busy too notice  an office girl in black rimmed  round glasses  ruby keeler  wants a chance to dance  his wife turns up saying she didn t divorce him after all  a blonde gold digger is setting her hooks in him  his partners are cheating him   my gosh  what s next  this may all sound like a lot to digest  but everything happens fast  with cagney bouncing  strutting  striding  finger snapping  barking orders and occasionally   until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing    doing a step or two just to show how it s done instead of  let s put on a show  gang  we have  we need to build three shows in three days  so lock the doors and let s start rehearsing   these three super prologues are going to feature    chorines  spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract  with forty kent units in deluxe movie houses   the whole apollo movie house circuit  exhaustion threatens  feet ache  but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes  which include ann sothern and dorothy lamour  you can quickly spot sothern but lamour is more generic  stay the course  dancing their hearts out  giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty and then the curtains go up as each prologue is presented in separate movie houses  one after the other on the same night  with the owner of the apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he ll save chester s skin or not first up is  honeymoon hotel  with dick powell and ruby keeler in a   minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness  with brides and grooms  some might even be married   bedrooms and beds  and doors with  do not disturb  signs then on to the next theater and    minutes of  by a waterfall  that probably had the warner brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy  this number is so excessive    dozens of swimming girls  trees  fountains  a huge grotto with waterslides  a giant pool    you d never think there was a depression on  berkeley pulls out all his tricks    synchronization  human patterns  legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things    and he does it in the water  with a lot of underwater photography looking up  the girls are sure game  they come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks  the whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting  ruby keeler  who has a couple of quick shots in the water  is the only one who looks a bit cautious and finally  the smash finale      minutes of cagney dancing and singing with keeler to  shanghai lil   with all sorts of bar girls and their customers  unusual in that the races are mixed up  there s cagney and keeler dancing on the bar  dancing on a table  cagney fighting  there are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines  hupping back and forth  rifles tossed and caught  then   this is true   a human picture forms of franklin roosevelt and the nra eagle  this may be the only hollywood musical production that has ever featured roosevelt  a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy chinese prostitutes that s entertainment  folks  it s great of course  chester s prologues get the big contract and nan gets chester  the movie is full of juicy clichs that make us smile  ruby keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along  joan blondell makes us forget about a lot of hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality  the movie  however  belongs to cagney  who grabs and shakes it  and to berkeley  a man for whom too much was never too much',1

'james cagney is best known for his tough characters  and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot  soft  characters in his career  this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star in cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing  and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it  he plays the role with a lot of confidence  he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time  so it actually isn t a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career  he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in the movie is directed by lloyd bacon  who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre  his earliest     s musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as    nd street   his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really      s musicals never were really about its singing  this was something that more featured in     s and later made musicals  mainly from the mgm studios as usual it has a light and simple story  set in the musical world  that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way  it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch  so do the characters and actors that are portraying them  sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie  when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done  even though i m not a too big fan of the genre itself  once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty  he often played little boys babies mice and whatever more early on in his career  including the movie musical  gold diggers of        of one year earlier a recommendable early genre movie',1

'i have a feeling that the warners bros depression era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years  yes  we are in the economic doldrums  or have you been living under a rock  and times look bleak  but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles  in the    s  film going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom   footlight parade         was one such film that audiences flocked to  while this lloyd bacon directed musical doesn t quite capture the social issues of the time as  gold diggers of              does  it s still a wonderful showcase of talent  we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers  but boy  are they worth waiting for me  yes  little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress  and her tapping is so so  but busby s magical  by a waterfall  whisks her  and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls  into a dizzying water wonderland  of course busby s numbers could never really be performed on a stage  they defy limits of gravity  for one thing   and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough  wisecracking non musical scenes  and  footlight  also has james cagney in at the one of his all too few musicals  really  what couldn t this man do    he even gets to take over from the leading man  don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil  who is really little ruby in china girl wig   he co stars with joan blondell  his adorable  adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women  until the final reel  that is   apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife  and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene',1

'an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early      s  audiences must ve been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle  quite a contrast from his  public enemy    years earlier  cagney does add spark   interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline   plot  but the highlight of the movie is the   elaborate production numbers back to back  first with the conservative  honeymoon hotel  number then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling  by a waterfall  sequence followed by the closing  shanghai lil  sequence  cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler  the  shanghai lil  number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown   anti climactic after the more exciting   incredibly mind boggling  by a waterfall  choreography if i was the director i would ve inserted the  shanghai lil  number in the middle   close with  by a waterfall  which blows the other   numbers out of the water so to speak   in my view the best of the   numbers  the   production numbers are the frosting on the cake   james cagney s performance is added decoration to the cake  an outstanding musical achievement a   star movie  the ultimate musical well worth watching you won t be disappointed',1

'passport to pimlico is a real treat for all fans of british cinema  not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy  but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age  with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british life stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton  who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb  discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the   th century duke of burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last     years accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by king edward iv of england  which has never been officially rescinded  to state that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil  which means that in the eyes of international law  pemberton and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it s own right and a law unto itself this sets the war battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and jurisdiction  so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books  destroy and ignore their clothing coupons  flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc  declaring themselves fully independent from britain however  what then happens is ever spiv  black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the  border  into burgundy as a refuge from the law and post war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods  and half of london s consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration  making their quiet happy little haven  a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that appealing to whitehall for assistance  they are told that due to developments this is  now a matter of foreign policy  which his majesty s government is reluctant to become involved  which leaves the residents high and dry  they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road  mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of pimlico eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege  with the bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food  but never the less fighting on in true british style  as one bugundian resident quotes   we re english and we always were english  and it s just because we are english  we are fighting so hard to be bugundians a sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them  by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades will whitehall  who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it s knees by this new batch of foreigners  especially as these ones are english    great tale  and great fun throughout  not to be missed',1

'my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer  today a writer and journalist  has put forward the theory that  just as british film makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called  thatcher s britain   the ealing comedies were intended as satires on  attlee s britain   the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the      general election  this theory was presumably not intended to apply to  say   kind hearts and coronets   which is  if anything  a satire on the edwardian upper classes  or to  the ladykillers  or  the lavender hill mob   both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature  it can  however  be applied to most of the other films in the series  especially  passport to pimlico  pimlico is  or at least was in the forties  a predominantly working class district of london  set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station  it is not quite correct to say  as has often been said  that the film is about pimlico  declaring itself independent  of britain  what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy  this means that  technically  pimlico is an independent state  and has been for nearly five hundred years  irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants  the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly  but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply because pimlico is not subject to british law  the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please  unhindered by the rationing laws  when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets  the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the  burgundians   as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves  to surrender many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system  either as an individual as happens in  the man in the white suit  or  the lavender hill mob   or as part of a larger community as happens in  whisky galore  or  the titfield thunderbolt   the central theme of  passport  is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties  the film s particular target is the rationing system  during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism  but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime  it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in       and organisations such as the british housewives  league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing  i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film s satire were the  spivs   black marketeers   who play a relatively minor part in the action  or the housewives  league  who do not appear at all  the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats  who are portrayed either as having a  rules for rules  sake  mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino   indeed  i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film   in       however  four years after the end of the war  the film makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity  so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain  one of the best known lines from the film is  we always were english and we always will be english and it s just because we are english that we re sticking up for our right to be burgundians   there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense  tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico  all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave  but in the last scene  after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain  global warming may have altered things slightly  but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief  whatever statistics might say to the contrary  that britain had an abnormally wet climate  the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton  the grocer and small time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico  and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor  in the main  however  this is  appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together  an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film  it lacks the ill will and rancour of many more recent satirical films  but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that  it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and  with the possible exception of  kind hearts and coronets  is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies',1

'every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state  i do not think this is the point of the film at all  the film parodies the spivs small time criminals who ran the blackmarket  and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation yes of course the film sends up the political social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society they want to be british and muddle through rather than foreign but i don t think they go back to being exactly like they were before',1

'i commend pictures that try something different  many films just seem like re treads of old ideas  so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlico the movie is set just after ww  and the post war shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners  barmy   the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico  they  too  are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it  that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago  with this document  they reason  they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want  since it turns out they really aren t british subjects  where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you ll need to see for yourselves  leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem',1

'spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence  in an early episode of cartoon  family guy  the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there  way back in      however  the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea after a child s prank  the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure  at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy  withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain  the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent state based at a time when rationing was still in operation  this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring  featuring performances by stanley holloway  betty warren  philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey  the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation  these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines  feeling remarkably fresh  despite being over    years old  the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained ealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence  with films like  passport to pimlico  it s not difficult to see why  amusing from start to finish  the story is always fun and always worth watching',1

'i love this show  it s sure to be a winner  jessica alba does a great job  it s about time we have a kick ass girl who s not the cutesy type  the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots  everything is layed out well  and thought over  to put it together must have taken a while  because it wasn t someone in a hurry that just slapped something together  it s a great show altogether',1

'this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london who  through an unusual set of circumstances  discover they are not english  but are an annex of the french province of burgundy the film features comic actor stanley holloway  best known as alfred doolittle in my fair lady   as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period the story was apparently based on a news item at the time  when the canadian government  officially  gave a hotel room to a visiting european member of royalty  the idea actually reminded me of the real life case of the hutt river province in western australia  where a landowner  seceded  from the australian government due to a wool quota dispute   it was never acknowledged by the western australian or australian governments  this is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues  rather like the tv show  yes minister   as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well',1

'this very funny british comedy shows what might happen if a section of london  in this case pimlico  were to declare itself independent from the rest of the uk and its laws  taxes   post war restrictions  merry mayhem is what would happen the explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that pimlico was ceded to the duchy of burgundy centuries ago  a small historical footnote long since forgotten  to the new burgundians  however  this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please  free from any interference from whitehall stanley holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world s tiniest nations  dame margaret rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with pimlico  others in the stand out cast include hermione baddeley  paul duplis  naughton wayne  basil radford   sir michael hordern welcome to burgundy',1

'i have to say i totally loved the movie  it had it s funny moments  some heartwarming parts  just all around good  me  personally  really liked the movie because it s something that finally i can relate to my childhood  this movie  in my opinion  is geared more towards the young gay population  it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up  all the taunting  name calling  and not knowing is something i  like most other young feminine boys  will always remember  and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay  so  i would definitely recommend seeing this movie  probably shouldn t really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it',1

'i get tired of my   and   year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon  disney and the like  it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again  when my daughters couldn t go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick  i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while  i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different  i flipped the channels  my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harvey s voice  i adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voice over work for a little duck     well  i couldn t change the channel  my daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together  the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed  it s not necessarily a proponent for  gay rights  but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything  i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another      too fat  too skinny  too feminine  being a bully  not being smart enough  only having one parent      you name it  kids  as a rule  can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience  my girls already accept others as they are and don t pick on others for being different  my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they re picked on  one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often    it warms my heart when kassie stands up for her   so  those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that it s an advocate for  gay rights  or are being forced to  accept certain views   you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoon and if you need it explained to you      well  you need more help than any television show could ever offer',1

'i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable  it is a quiet  little film that doesn t overwhelm you with special effects or  big  performances  it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker  a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods  toker s search for the baby s parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life  david srathairn plays truman lester  a slimy conman with an ulterior motive  and david plays the bad guy to perfection there is much more to this film than first meets the eye  filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music  it is worth watching',1

'henry thomas was  great   his character held my attention  i was so  into  the story that i forgot it wasn t real  i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was  the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character  the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring  i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head  in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself',1

'this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen  i love the backwoods feel of this movie  the movie is very realistic and believable  this seems to take place in another era  maybe the late    s or early    s  henry thomas works well with the young baby  very moving story and worth a look',1

'i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary  what i love most about it is that it is understated and low key  but deeply heartfelt  henry thomas   he played the child in e t   performance is masterfully inarticulate  he is supposed to be a man of few words   david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain  and miraculously  given that we re talking about a hollywood product here  a baby serves as a main character  but one who doesn t act or have lines  but rather just is    is luminous at that   interesting to note that thomas  mysterious relationship w  e t  was the core of that film  while his bond w  the baby serves as the core of  a good baby  then there is the music  ah  what music   gillian welch s tunes are wonderful   the entire score is gorgeous hill country music this film is wonderfully atmospheric  i recommend it highly',1

'dark angel is a cross between huxley s brave new world and percy s love in the ruins  portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order  both in the worst sense of the word  once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by  the pulse   it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters  max  the dark angel bike messenger  and logan  the rich rebel   it seems uneven  perhaps a result of a variety of authors  but is held together by the energetic  beautiful  and charming jessica alba  who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive  i think that fox has done it again',1

'a sweet natured young mountain man with a sad past  henry thomas  comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her  the town elders generally support him in keeping the child  though a local temptress  cara seymour  thinks little of the new family  a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman  david strathairn at his creepiest  have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way  this is a charming slice of life in the ozarks in the same vein as  where the lillies bloom     the dollmaker   all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple living    but not simple minded    american folk  a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly safe family viewing',1

'what another reviewer called lack of character development  i call understatement  the movie didn t bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory  yes  there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of  but this was primarily a one day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters  lives  henry thomas s performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action  good rental',1

'this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick   carrie  and others  and barbara bach  it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it s worth it  this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time  it seems that   young newswomen  karen  vicky  and jennifer  travel to the small city of solvang  california to cover a festival when a mix up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller  lassick  and his strange wife virginia  vickie stays behind  feeling ill  as the other   are off to film their story  she is soon murdered at the house  in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system  she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement   soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover  jennifer is fighting with her  ex  lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home  her hosts  whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son  devise a plot to try to murder her as well  virgina does not totally agree with earnest s plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior  here the film turns almost comic as junior  portrayed hysterically by stephen furst  is a deformed  mentally deficient  manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it s supposed to be scary  this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done  the actors actresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick  furst  and bach and although it s not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining',1

'the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show  the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable  the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old  but good acting and production make the movie worth watching  the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects  i rated it an   out of',1

'upon the first viewing  i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tales  after many more  i think it s one of the best  some of the songs are pretty bad  especially the love song  but two things stand out that make the movie  even the singing  worthwhile  one is the art direction  like the other cannon movie tales  this is a beautifully decorated period piece  every piece of cloth and jewel  both of which have major parts in this movie s plot  look fresh and new  and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants  even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess  wonderfully done  the other thing is the comic timing  a lot of the movie is cheesy  but the emperor s vanity  and his making fun of himself in the end   the suspicious guard  the guard chasing nicholas  and the stupid prince  were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose  and the sequence during the song weave o makes up for the songs that weren t so good',1

'hatred of a minute  is a hauntingly beautiful film  a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer  eric seaver  strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a  must see  for any film student or horror fan  the realness of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies  some shout outs to the film s producer  bruce campbell as well as to the film  the evil dead  add some humor for anyone that knows the genre',1

'so what constitutes a real independent film  in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge  i m sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy which is why we should be glad that films like  hatred of a minute  exist  across the board  this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template  indie horror film   love it or hate it   hatred  isn t afraid of being what it is  and in watching this film  you get the real sense that kallio  the director  didn t just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place  he s in this to tell stories  good ones  you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store  but don t be fooled  this story is also about love  about good people pushed over the edge  and that oh so distant light at the end of the tunnel if you expect smut  or an evil dead ripoff  stay away from this film  but if you dig the finer points of the horror suspense genres  check this film out yes  bruce campbell did produce this movie  and i m sure he s proud to tell anyone that it s not  evil dead   bruce has never tried to bank on his  ash  image  and it s obvious that he didn t get involved with  hatred  so that it could do so either my advice  though  to all dead ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr  campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr  kallio and mr  campbell are trying to show you the acting is well done  although nothing about this film is oscar caliber  perhaps intentionally   it s good to see compassionate performances in a horror film  so often  actors in films such as these don t even seem to try  with  hatred   it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously  never resorting to typical horror film campiness technically   hatred  is about as competent as indie film gets  the editing is fast paced  the cinematography is good given the budget  and  hatred  keeps a quick pace  without any bog down points or bad anti climaxes all in all  hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi million dollar fake indies  but personally  i don t see a problem with that  it s a film by folks who actually care about the medium  people who reached into thier broke ass pockets  pulled out thier nickles and dimes  threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie check this one out',1

'i think this show is definitely the greatest show  jessica alba does such a great job in it  michael weatherly also does an awesome job  as well as the rest of the cast  the show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing  it s like watching a   hour movie  it s definitely worth watching',1

'i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words  clueless and appalling nonsense   i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment  one has to suspend one s disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love  have a child and live together happily ever after  but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one s heart warmed  is it so impossible  there are far more implausible events described in other movies  the acting is good  the script is funny  the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality',1

'this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in       it was a revelation to us  we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children  obviously we were wrong  love may come from where you don t expect it and maybe don t want it  but we both chose that love anyway and no  it never changed our sexual orientation  that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos when we were young we both had affairs  but never with the opposite sex  as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs this story is not far fetched  however  the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me  my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last    years  we are still gay  end of story',1

'this is a film for entertainment  i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film  i personally find this film funny  audacious  and memorable  it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess  this film was done very well i might add  in the    s a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person s sexuality  this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not  it is however about love  in all it s strange forms  this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the    s in hollywood  or in california  pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men  women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career  bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community then the fantasy begins   let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have  well this movie  which in any way was better than that dismal redo  the next big thing   perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the    s and it still brings a smile to my lips now  i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny  tender movie  to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun  some people need to lighten up    and this is the film you should do it with',1

'this movie is as unique as it is overlooked      a different story is just that  it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain  one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind  i first saw this on cable in the late    s and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time  i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life  it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family  this film should be available on dvd vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster   perry king can be acknowledged  but to show how far we have come   still have to go where relationships are concerned',1

'in order to stop her homosexual friend albert  perry king  from being deported back to belgium  stella  meg foster  decides to marry him  the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian  the two have their separate lives when one night after albert s birthday party  they fall into bed and then into love  later in the film after falling in love  stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing  what she finds will leave the viewer stunned  this is a great film  very original  perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here  very controversial upon its release in       the  r  rated film is now  pg  in this much more liberal time recently released on dvd  the disc contains a  making of  segment on the special features and in it it s stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not  real  are mistaken  everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved',1

'i appreciated the photography  the textures  the colours and often  unlike one comment  the lighting  what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline i found it often disjointed  badly edited and at times difficult to follow  my version was     minutes  imdb shows one at    m  possibly the cuts and subtitles didn t help  i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed  miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine  i just wanted a little more dialogue  if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one  try  hideous kinky with kate winslet',1

'this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire  well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone  and learn about the people who lived there i enjoyed the story  characters  acting and scenes  a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly  otherwise a wonderful piece the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it  the scenes with her and alex descas  nadir  are charming and lovely i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating',1

'harem suare is the best film i saw in the year       bravo ferzan ozpetek  sensually shot and stunningly portrayed  harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance  which is such a taboo in hollywood  women of all shapes  sizes  and color  populate the film  cut off from the outside world  the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue  rivalry and jealousies within their ranks',1

'when i think about this movie  all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world  texture  smell  color  that s how i think this movie should be judged in terms of  see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace  or the sweltering turkish bath  and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice  coarse cloth  smooth skin  scented oils  flickering flames  satin rustle  don t just watch and listen  be absorbed  let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you',1

'this is an absolute great show  jessica alba  besides being the most beautiful women in the world  is a great actress  she does a great job of portraying max  and i could never see anyone else doing that role  she is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous',1

'this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion  with cool characters  lots of action  and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren  however alex karzis is awful as the villain   the story is very good  and i found the kids to be likable for the most part  plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this   the action scenes are excellent  and it s almost like die hard except it s set in a school   plus kata dob is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick   the finale is very exciting  and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well   however i just wished it had another villain  because alex karzis just didn t cut it as the villain way too ott  and laughable for my tastes  this should be higher then     in my opinion  as i thought it was a great action film  and while the kids  were very stupid at times  they got quite resourceful as the movie went along   plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well   the ending is very amusing and corey sevier s character was my favorite student   plus dolph has still got it   this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion  with cool characters  lots of action  and an amazing performance from lundgren   but alex karzis is awful as the villain  still i highly recommend this one   the direction is very good   sidney j  furie does a very good job here with great camera work  good angles  and keeping the film at a very fast pace   there is a bit of blood and violence  we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds knife in the side of the head  bloody arrow hits  an impaling  and other minor stuff  the acting is fantastic   dolph lundgren is amazing as always  and is amazing here  he is extremely likable  kicks that ass as usual  had great chemistry with the kids  had an awesome character  is very charismatic  and he may not have shown a great emotional rage  he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch   he is one of my favorite actors   lundgren rules        alex karzis is god awful as the villain  he is laughably ott  was boring  and not menacing at all  he also annoyed the crap out of me  kata dob is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do  she was the real villain in my opinion   corey sevier is funny as mick  he was my favorite student  and i really started to warm up to him in the  nd half  i liked him a lot   he had good chemistry with dolph too  dov tiefenbach willy  chris collins hogie  mpho koaho jay tee  danielle hampton alicia  nicole dicker charlee  all do great as the students  jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fiance  rest of the cast do fine  overall i highly recommend this one          out of',1

'i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw  it was a cool fun movie dolph looked superbly cool on the bike he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies he is now in a pretty good shape the story was ok and the other actors were also passable i wouldn t call this movie his best but its still a good movie but it also had its share of problems  the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target they should ve had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way  another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing  i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom  the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers  there should ve been more bad guys  last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy   but that was due to the small budget  overall the movie was a good movie i enjoyed it i would recommend others to watch it  p s  now u r a dead beat cop   some one liners were also cool',1

'there has been a political documentary  of recent vintage  called why we fight  which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation  it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq  yet  a far more famous series of films  with the same name  was made during world war two  by hollywood director frank capra  although considered documentaries  and having won oscars in that category  this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop  more in the vein of leni reifenstal s triumph of the will  scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes  that said  that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries  such as the bbc s lauded the world at war  lacked  nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable  they are skillfully made  and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store  i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase  i chose goodtimes dvd s four dvd collection of the series rarely has something free been so worth invaluable  while there are no extras on the dvds  and the sound quality of the prints varies  these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago  when racism was overt  as in many of the classic warner brothers pro war cartoons of the era   and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts  the seven films  produced between      and       are prelude to war  the nazis strike  divide and conquer  the battle of britain  the battle of russia  the battle of china  and war comes to america overall  the film series is well worth watching  not only for the obvious reasons  but for the subtle things it reveals  such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars  rather than the modern singular  or the most overused graphic in the whole series  a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria  yet  it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars  the lesson of world war one  avoid foreign entanglements  was not applicable to world war two  whose own lesson  act early against dictatorships  has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since  korea  vietnam  nor iraq  the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today s information clogged times  it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today  but at least you ll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position  nor will you be the last',1

'the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler s grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the  allied bias  turning out to be historical fact  the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east  the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds the disparity between hitler s military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag  declaring  peace in our time  to this day has durable propaganda qualities  here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options  freedom or slavery  in      there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively',1

'adolf hitler s maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u s  war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii  hitler s plan was methodical and well conceived  starting with the conquest of eastern europe  expanding to the european heartland  then moving on to the  world island  consisting of europe  asia and africa  his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world in       hitler ordered national conscription  as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell  grade school children sang his praises  and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps  marching unopposed into austria in       hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland  in       hitler took all of czechoslovakia  later in the year  the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non aggression pact with it s mortal enemy russia  a ploy to delay hitler s military involvement on too many fronts  immediately after  germany invaded poland  bringing hitler s conquest right to russia s doorstep  he would deal with her later it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler s thrust across europe  prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany  his infamous declaration stating  peace in our time   it didn t turn out that way the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment  at least to me  was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid     s  it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland  the venue   madison square garden',1

'this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war  the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler s rise every school child  nay  every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos  history has been repeating itself over and over again  the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking  the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups  are still working to these evil group s advantage by sitting back and letting hitler as early as      be aggressive   france  america and england caused over    million people s deaths  americans  french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs  they don t tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them  fighting hitler  this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war',1

'i can t understand what it is that fans of the genre didn t like about this film  it was truly a lot of fun  the special effects were wonderful  i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters  but not this time  i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn t enjoy the film  i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen  but again this was not the case  to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time  blair witch and the mummy  both films that i thought were terrible  blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time  the mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck  people liked it for it s special effects  films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development  they are more like funhouse rides  well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting s e ticket',1

'what can i say that hasn t been said about  the haunting   it has everything that would make a great picture  wonderful sets  moody music  and sound design to die for were all in place  the screenplay  though  sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird  surrealistic way  the entire team must have forgotten to read it through  maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was  each member of the cast gives a worthy performance  although with little conviction to the material at hand  lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her  but that s about it  all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours  but you will definitely want more  a lot more',1

'i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the season  although season  was not as good as season  which is excellent indeed   i like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on amazon  failed     i am a chinese student and it s inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and    i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow',1

'i rented this movie this past weekend  cranked up the surround sound system  and got some great sound from special affects  this movie is a great movie rental  the special affects where enough to scare my fiance  but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated  i didn t go to the movies and see this  but its a scary late night don t feel like going out movie  i would recommend it',1

'i don t know why the critics trashed this movie  i hardly ever agree with them anyway the movie could have been a little scarier   i don t usually go to horror movies  i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime  i needn t have bothered      the cinema was full of kids too  heh         liam was great as always  i also liked catharine zeta jones  theo  and lili taylor  eleanor nell the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way  the special and sound effects were awesome  i also loved the music score  particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children  how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power  peace and freedom',1

'i know it is fashionable now to hate this movie  i have seen hundreds of spook films including he original      haunting as well as most of the hammer films  this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it  yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts  actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great  i have seen it    times now and it gets better every time  the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the  th sense  the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring  perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure  the old haunting was also a fine film from       it was even more scary  see both and also the innocents and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin',1

'jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts   one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget box office ones  it s a mere    minutes and doesn t feature many sets  and the only star is barbara stanwyck  but what a star  of course stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert  the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor  who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help  some psychological battling there it s a surprisingly effective little movie   its short length makes it taut  and that stanwyck is great should go without mention  but i ll still praise her every time',1

'jeopardy is a tense  satisying thriller  a cut above a b but not really a major production  it qualifies as almost an experimental film  as the studio that produced it  metro  was desperately looking for new kinds of films  stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television  the director  john sturges  was an up and comer whose best years lay ahead  he had just recently begun directing a level films  and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman  stars barbara stanwyck  barry sullivan and ralph meeker  were at very different phases of their careers  stanwyck s glory years were behind her  and yet she could still carry a film  as she proves here  barry sullivan  as her husband  was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him  he was a fine  low key actor  poised  but in an upper middle rather than upper class way  which made him excellent in professional roles  as the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save sullivan s life  he is trapped under a pier  and the tide is rising   ralph meeker is more energetic than usual  this excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after brando and clift  he was in his way as good an actor as either of them  but he lacked charisma  his bargaining with stanwyck  which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband  by implication only  as this is        makes for an intriguing premise which  had this been a different kind of film  could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about stanwyck s character  meeker is indeed a more exciting character than sullivan  and in her scenes with him stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son  but as this is a formula picture  not a strindberg play  the possibility that stanwyck might want want to have a fling   leaving aside the question of her husband s predicament   remains unexplored  in this sense the incoming tide doesn t quite have the effect one might have wished  though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting  fine location photography  nearly all of it outdoors  and excellent direction by the woefully underrated mr  sturges',1

'here s an excellent barbara stanwyck double bill on one disc  the first movie   and believe me the lesser of the two   is mgm s  to please a lady         in which she is paired with clark gable  it is essentially a star vehicle with gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence  here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins  of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close  a bit of a fluff of a move really but gable and stanwyck   two icons of the golden age   make it watchable but the real meat on this dvd is the second feature   a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called jeopardy  produced by mgm in      this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn t dated one iota  here stanwyck plays the wife of barry sullivan and mother to their young son lee aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes  a dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what  yes the tide is coming in  with not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself stanwyck sets off by car for assistance  after driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict  ralph meeker  who   in return for his help   wants more from her than money or a change of clothes   i ll do anything to save my husband    does she or doesn t she   meeker runs away with the picture  he turns in quite a brilliant performance  once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him  an actor in the smouldering brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films  although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury  disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding mann stewart western  naked spur         and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in stanley kubrick s powerful ww  drama  paths of glory         his only real claim to fame was as mike hammer in mickey spillane s  kiss me deadly  in       his performance in  jeopardy  should have done wonders for him but he had only a so so career in films  he died in      because of this release  jeopardy  can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir  a memorable  taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances  tight direction by john sturges  the crisp monochrome cinematography of victor milner and an atmospheric score by dimitri tiomkin  extras  however are no great shakes except for a radio version of  jeopardy  and trailers for both movies this disc is also part of a barbara stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary  hard to believe that the lady would be over     years old if she was still around jeopardy   an mgm winner',1

'as a disclaimer  i ve seen the movie     times in the last    years  and i only just saw the musical this week  this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn t in the musical  however  it tainted me when i watched the musical     i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role  along with kasey  i think her  let me dance for you scene  is one of the best parts of the movie  a worthwhile addition compared to the musical  the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical  as well as the cast which is at least    times bigger  easier to do in the movie of course   the decors  lighting  dancing  and singing are also much superior in the movie  which should be expected  and was indeed delivered the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie  the new ones are quite good ones  and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion  especially compared to a musical which has few decors  the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking  and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters  but their dancing is impeccable  and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical',1

'when i really began to be interested in movies  at the age of eleven  i had a big list of  must see  films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend  some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts  i remember one of the films on that list was  a chorus line  and could never get it  so now to see it is a dream come true of course  i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there  i mean  take  a chorus line   a stage play turned into film  i know it s something we see a lot nowadays  but back then it was a little different  apparently  and this film has something special most of the musicals made movies today  take the chance the camera gives them for free  to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places   a chorus line  was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie  following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach  michael douglas   richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job everything happens on the same day  the tension of not knowing  the stress of having to learn the numbers  the silent competition between the dancersand it all occurs on the stage  where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences  there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic  but they list shortens as the hours go by like a movie i saw recently   a prairie home companion   the broadcast of a radio show  atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity  on or behind the stage  things are going on  and time doesn t seem to stop  again  i don t if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this  but it sure doesn t look like it  and anyway it s a great directing and editing  john bloom  work  but in that little stage  what you wonder is what to do with the camerawith only one setting  ronnie taylor s cinematography finds the way  making close ups to certain characters  zooming in and out  showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york in one crucial moment  douglas tells the ones that are left   before we start eliminating  you re all terrific and i d like to hire you all  but i can t   this made me think about reality shows today  where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving  even when they are not good   it s hard  you must imagine  at least here  where all of them really are terrific to tell some of the stories  the characters use songs and  in one second  the stage takes a new life and it literally is  a dream come true   the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws  showing these dancers  feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett  the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman  which is very touching at times  so if it s not with a song it will be with a word  but in  a chorus line   it s impossible not to be moved during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition  cassie  a special dancer played by alyson reed  takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it  the words  let me dance for you  never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics',1

'i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway  i love the broadway musical and i love the movie  i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show  i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies  so i developed a philosophy really early  assume that the movie is going to be based on the book   or musical in this case  but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same  it will be different so watch it for what it is i danced for    years before i had to make a choice  i was a good dancer  picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc  but i wasn t super talented i was however super talented as a show rider  i was told by my dance instructor and my trainer   who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state  that i had to make a choice when i turned     that i needed to move up from dancing two hours four five days a week and riding   hours a day   days a week   and dedicate to one or the other  so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies  i just chose to watch this movie for what it is  it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction  it is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it  i love the movie  i love the broadway musical',1

'anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly  i would refer them to roger ebert s review of this movie  he is one of the most respected critics in the industry  and he gave it       stars this is a great movie  it may not be perfect  or spectacular  but i enjoyed it  a chorus line is not so much a story  as it is a group of stories about the lives of broadway hopefuls  i read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between zach and cassie  that is an incorrect view  it is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the broadway hopefuls  what people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through  and that i think is really the point of the whole show  it is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers  but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general  this is a study of life as a broadway star  anyone who has dreamed of becoming a broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through this is a great musical  it has its slow points  and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines  but all in all  i thoroughly enjoyed it  take a closer look at the movie  and then maybe you will understand what i am talking about',1

'i don t agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the american international pictures  basil deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war england  but without the sentimentality of  blackboard jungle    the cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate  the estate looked like an old prison  stanley baker was excellent as the hardened detective  reassigned to the juvenile division    urgent  urgent   larceny   five iced lollies      he finds he is the butt of many jokes  david mccallum showed that he was one of britain s top young talents of the fifties   he had a very different role in another stanley baker film  hell drivers    his portrayal of johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening  ann heywood was also very good as the cynical cathie  i wouldn t say there was a romantic subplot in it detective jack truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the  firefly   just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough  he is assigned to the juvenile division   he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work  amid all the heckling he gets his first call out   the   year old murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops   taking the twins home he meets their brother  the charismatic johnny  and their embittered sister cathie  he starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals  as he gets more involved with the family  he realises there is a strong link between the fires  johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a laundry  the local priest  peter cushing in an unusual role  away from the hammer horrors  explains that when johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero  he wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires  the school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children s fear   the teacher  thinking only of her own safety  runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman    i thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems britain experienced after the war highly recommended',1

'i ve long wanted to see this film  being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum  i agree that the romantic sub plot was a waste of time  but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role  thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week  i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war  especially with the way things were throughout the     s  some of the boys are a bit scary  i certainly wouldn t want to met them on a well lit street  much less a dark one  there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well  or as they call him  a firefly',1

'this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool  and was the uk s answer to films such as  blackboard jungle   the film stands the test of time quite well  with all the moral stories still  or even more  relevant today  the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum  stanley baker  peter cushing and anne heywood  baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties  with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age  they will end up being responsible adults notable cameos in the film include freddie starr  fred fowell  and melvyn hayes  gloria   tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister  they are real life brother and sister  who are caught up in an arsonists web  tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film  the interpretor  violent playground features a gun siege in a school  so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland   russia i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot  though was not born at the time   and have fond memories of the area  i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from  violent playground   and a small uk film  coast to coast  which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite  the tenements were demolished in      and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released  as the film portrayed the area in a bad light  time has helped heal those wounds a little gem of a film  i would recommend you seek this out',1

'this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society  rather than being a lucid parody of     s teenage life  in an attempt to celebrate the work of liverpool s junior liaison officers the opening title points out that     of potential delinquents  who have been dealt with under this scheme  have not committed a second crime  however  this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen drama until the film s epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn t feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed up they might seem stanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile liaison officer  this hard boiled character is a role typical of baker  having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer  however  as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events  back to his original investigation his first case leads him to the home of two young children  mary and patrick murphy  played by real life brother and sister duo   who have committed a petty theft  here he meets cathie  satisfyingly portrayed by anne heywood  their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with  it quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency the elder brother of the murphy family  johnny  is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums  mccallum does an eye catching turn as the americanized mixed up kid  who owes more to the likes of marlon brando  than any previous british star  one is reminded of brando s character johnny from  the wild one  who led a leather clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film s  johnny  leads his gang thankfully the preachiness of earlier dearden crime dramas such as  the blue lamp  is not so apparent  instead we are presented with several well drawn out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between heywood and baker takes the forefront the plot  whilst at times predictable  does deliver some memorable scenes  the disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny abandons himself to the music  leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant  the most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children  including mary and patrick  are held hostage at gunpoint by johnny  obviously in the light of the real life dumblaine massacre this scene seems all the horrifying  understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences',1

'in watching this early demille work  it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille  his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable  his pacing is very good  enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so  it is a pity that he wasn t as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely  she was remarkable  quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions the ending is wonderful',1

'and i am a nicole kidman fanatic  i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book  which  for all i know  she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie all four of the principals are excellent  but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie  this one asks too much of the viewer it could have been very funny  which it is in parts  or quite frightening  which it is in one scene  but the director didn t seem to know which way to go',1

'i didn t really know what to expect when going out to watch the film  apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet  that and it had nicole kidman in it  i absolutely loved the film though  and came out thinking  wow  refreshingly down to earth  the film moves along nicely  with a few suprises at each corner  the relationships in the film are believeable  with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully  the humour is subtle  with some great  office  like scenes at the bank  and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation  it s less about heroics and more about delicate relationships  brit filmmaking at its best',1

'as usual  hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie  but  this one is a classic   from the uptight white collar banker to the russian woman   well done  even facial expressions were great  language was perfect  even in russian language  and nicole did a splendid job   hey guys   you get what you pay for',1

'i think dark angel is great  first season was excellent  and had a good plot  with max jessica alba  as an escaped x    manticore creation  trying to adapt to a normal life  but still  saving the world   and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first  the plot kinda disappeared  and the series lost a little of it s charm  mostly because of all the weird  creatures  appearing  don t get me wrong the second season is good  but with a little bit to much of the  manticores   however  they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season    in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of so i really wish they could start making new episodes  and with james cameron behind this it can t go wrong  so as a conclusion i would say it s a great series  however i m still hoping for a third season',1

'excellent movie  albeit slightly predictable  i have to comment on nicole kidmans acting in this movie  some of her other works haven t shown the amazing talent this woman has  but birthday girl doesn t suffer from this in the slightest  even without words kidmans acting shines through',1

'a small funny film  it is totally incredible  unbelievable  impossible  but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized  even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms  of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet  you must not believe ten percent of what you re told there and never  ever  ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally  most of their  businesses  there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you  but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive  he is absurdly silly  but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning  one think is sure too  security in english airports is not exactly what it should be  but i guess it s not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically  then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage  a real plague on modern airports  and don t expect to get fair compensation  or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous  i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener  funny  isn t it  dr jacques coulardeau  university paris dauphine  university paris   pantheon sorbonne   university versailles saint quentin en yvelines',1

'when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could  only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it  i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control  with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment  imho  thus for instance  dogville  even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home  or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else s attention  or other pet causes of kidman s here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job  i don t how or who was able to restrain her  but apparently it worked  the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman  and consequently  what makes a man s most desperate hopes marginally attainable of course  the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy  but his transformation is adequately believable  it isn t coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego  instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human  apart from their criminal mission  her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture  and while they are his adversaries  they are never really his enemy  in effect  they teach him to be compete i really marveled at kidman s ability to physically appear russian  it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian  but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it  maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film  despite my gratuitous digs at ms  kidman  the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime',1

'this movie really woke me up  like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber this guy john  ben chaplin  leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town  until the stunningly gorgeous  wild  girl to die for nadia  nicole kidman   ordered by email from russia  enters his life to become his beloved wife  by johns plan  however a glitch turns up   nadia does not speak a word of johns language  although calm and emotionless on the outside  john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service  he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently paid safe feeling clerk into a decision making decently thinking action figure  giving the viewer a subliminal message  you would have probably acted likewise  kidman  cassel   kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing   almost  only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues  however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right  nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles  at least from the cultural background the pace of the film is fast and captivating  and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear  you rather feel that you re in the middle of the plot  and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy  to sum it up  it has an unusual plot  great acting  and ideas below the surface  like the idea of the  rude awakening  from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society s machine  the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings   welcome to the machine     i bet that in the end  john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all thank you  writers  for the great story  and everyone else for this great movie  please make a sequel  and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever  because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the         percent of the potential viewers  i am sure of it',1

'jessica alba s max and valerie rae miller s original cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial  wonderfully politically incorrect  quality varies greatly from episode to episode  but generally the standard is high and when it is not  jessica is always worth looking at  valerie s urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging dark angel into sitcom territory',1

'i really have to disagree with guy yardley rees who  should he have watched the entire film  would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery  some of the best ever shot in skye  and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole this is not a big budget film  rather it is a film that has a strong community feel i can t say how much  standard  films bore me   pushing out the same polished stuff again and again  seachd doesn t seem to be about that at all  it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film ok  so the acting isn t in the style a blockbuster  that s because the actors are seemingly real people  i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing   and at times unusually beautiful seachd really bears a second viewing  since there are many threads that become clearer second time around   that really do feed into the ending overall  the combination of music and  at times  stunning visuals  plus a community approach to the acting and non normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film  more of these please',1

'i would highly recommend this movie  and i certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad  it was with excited anticipation  that i have just pre ordered it online  i enjoyed it so much  it is not out until february march       but it will be well worth the wait  but first go and see it in the cinema if you can  there is nothing quite like the cinema experience of a cinema made movie  insist that your local cinema puts it on  i went to see  seachd  the inaccessible pinacle  tonight  down here in london  and was really impressed  it is a marvel  a truly beautiful film set in the scottish highlands  you will laugh  you will cry  you will be moved in may different ways  you will be intrigued  and as the story within the stories is revealed  you will be amazed at that revelation this movie is in scottish gaelic with english subtitles  but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the gaelic  i am just starting  and my son does not  nor did many people there tonight  and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means  superlatives do not suffice  the photography is superb   there is no cgi here  and the movie is all the better for that  here you have true photography  the script is so skilfully and subtly written  the many layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers  the music is at times rousing  at times haunting  but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance  and the acting      it is to behold     and the actors     they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film  particularly the two main actors   padruig the young  and  padruig the elder   a true bard  if ever there was    who both carried a very heavy load  and the direction  well watch out richard  and the producer  responsible for raising funding  hiring key personnel  and arranging for distributors  a task well done  i hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad  and the gaelic community  uill  without you it could not have happened  we were told that this movie was made on a low budget  but you would not know it  and i think it might well be because  for what they might have lacked in money  they more than made up for with the richness of the heart  and the warmth and co operation of the local scottish gaelic community a heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making  and the sponsoring  of  seachd    mran taing   many thanks   from the gaels to the world  from the world to the gaels',1

'this movie is best described or compare to  big fish   the movie by tim burton   but it s a less glamorous and more in you face tale  and of course here it s not the father  but his grandfather who tells the stories the movie s narrative also moves back and forth  so the story outline here at imdb  might tell you more than you would like to read  before watching the movie   it s funny and engaging enough  even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too  it also surprises you here and there  with things you wouldn t expect  a nice little movie then  that deserves your attention  especially if you like movies like that   o',1

'an angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather  together they find common ground in the gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders  although tragic episodes  such as the highland clearances  feature in the stories  there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them  it s all filmed in skye  so there is a double dose of beauty  the mountain scenery is breathtaking  and it s a rare chance to hear scottish gaelic spoken  i m english  so i had to read the subtitles  but the sound of spoken gaelic is nonetheless wonderful  the performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non actors   in other words  you are watching the real thing   people who care deeply about gaelic folklore and history  the gaelic community  especially on skye  worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film  anyone who has the slightest interest in gaelic  folk history  folk music  oral culture  scotland  british history  multi culturalism or social justice should go and see this film',1

'the scots excel at storytelling  the traditional sort  many years after the event  i can still see in my mind s eye an elderly lady  my friend s mother  retelling the battle of culloden  she makes the characters come alive  her passion is that of an eye witness  one to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she lives of course  it happened many years before she was born  but you wouldn t guess from the way she tells it  the same story is told in bars the length and breadth of scotland  as i discussed it with a friend one night in mallaig  a local cut in to give his version  the discussion continued to closing time stories passed down like this become part of our being  who doesn t remember the stories our parents told us when we were children  they become our invisible world  and  as we grow older  they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir  fact and fiction blend with aspiration  role models  warning stories  archetypes  magic and mystery  my name is aonghas  like my grandfather and his grandfather before him   our protagonist introduces himself to us  and also introduces the story that stretches back through generations  it produces stories within stories  stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of scotland  its rugged mountains shrouded in mists  the stuff of legend  yet seach d is rooted in reality  this is what gives it its special charm  it has a rough beauty and authenticity  tempered with some of the finest gaelic singing you will ever hear aonghas  angus  visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death  he burns with frustration  part of him yearns to be in the twenty first century  to hang out in glasgow  but he is raised on the western shores among a gaelic speaking community yet there is a deeper conflict within him  he yearns to know the truth  the truth behind his grandfather s ancient stories  where does fiction end  and he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents he is pulled to make a last fateful journey  to the summit of one of scotland s most inaccessible mountains  can the truth be told  or is it all in stories in this story about stories  we revisit bloody battles  poisoned lovers  the folklore of old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth  in doing so  we each connect with angus  as he lives the story of his own life seachd  the inaccessible pinnacle is probably the most honest  unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of scotland ever made  like angus  i got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories  but  also like angus  i forgave this once i saw the  bigger picture   forget the box office pastiche of braveheart and its like  you might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of the wicker man  to see a film that is true to scotland  this one is probably unique  if you maybe meditate on it deeply enough  you might even re evaluate the power of storytelling  and the age old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced',1

'excellent show  instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it s the same old thing  just different  stars   this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations  we have been away from watching any television for   years and after coming back  of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on w  shame on global for pulling the plug on this one  i thought this one would be a winner  let s be realistic about things  few canadian shows make it  everyone i talk to enjoys this show and i believe it was foolish of global to walk away  i guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the states instead of pulling behind a canadian made show that had a lot of promise  don t get me wrong  i enjoy a lot of shows on tv  but  come on people  let s keep the variety  this unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships  with unique characters that you don t see on any sitcoms today or in the past  too bad that global had to say no to this one  foolish mistake',1

'spacecamp is my favorite movie  it is a great story and also inspires others the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie  it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie the   th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up  i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school  i also know a close friend of the late pilot i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up  i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers  invisible   going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result  so i m much closer to the accident and any movie similarities  i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later  strangely enough  on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in      and who later built endeavour',1

'definitely needed a little work in season    such as the virus between max and logan  and ames white along with his ancient  super cult  during season two  however  the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting max  very good drama in season two  but of course like all tv shows  if there s something a little wrong with it  the broadcasting company takes it off the air  i was seriously hoping for a third and final season  season   leaves you hanging  unless you read the books by max allan collins  then you will know what happens dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again  since jessica alba s carrier sky rocketed after the show  if that would be the case  then there should be a movie to complete it  just like the show firefly  which of course fox canceled as well',1

'hurrah  a space film that doesn t take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp  the film starts slowly  the usual mix of idiots and high fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup  but when the going gets tough   the tough get themselves sorted out and it s not an un believable change in the characters as you can believe that there s some responsibility in their young minds the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the  i m right and you re all wrong  instructor  i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a   vote',1

'this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish  but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit  like super cool  with a  like totally bitchin  belt and stick on rhinestones on her face but anyways  the movie is actually one of the few  family  movies that holds your interest  i know that the begining drags  particuarly if you know what is going to happen  but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film i wouldn t stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie  in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself  but i ll admit it here with the internet to hide behind',1

'spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love  and mom and dad can have fun watching as well  growing up in the    s i enjoyed this movie  it s plot and all the actors  i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own  they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did  the plot is fun  a group of kids  embark on a journey they never expected  when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot  they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn t have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in  once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life',1

'i ve been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too  some of the users are stuck in a  realist  type of mentality  this film was meant to be a  fantasy     a  what if  fun film  it was never meant to be  real  or serious  it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out   even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion   i was    at the time and totally enjoyed this one   my young son loved it too  later  i shared it with my daughter and she  too  loved it  spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that   fun  all the  realists  in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film  so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp  one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california    they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt  letdown    i guess their parents didn t explain the difference between fantasy and reality  oh well  if you love fantasy fun films and haven t seen this one  i highly recommend it  enjoy',1

'space camp is a pretty decent film  the plot is predictable  but the actors do a good job  and the special effects are decent for the time this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster  and that really put a hamper on how popular it was the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular    on the big screen  that is    on a tv    it just looks average  i remember this scene in the theater  it made you feel like you were really up there this would be a good film to see on imax  but i m sure that will never happen',1

'a few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot  and the oxygen in ship was running short  they had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks  etc  etc first of all  this movie s plot is not possible in real life  but it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years   i saw this movie for the first time in the year of       it was filmed in       there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood the view was great from outer space  it does not look unreal  it is about   hours long  it runs so fast that you won t even notice  you know that it is not real  but you just get sucked into it until the end overall  it is a good family movie',1

'i would like to comment the series as a great effort  the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well  especially in season    season   however became more of a freak show  and lost da s original charm  season one story line was more interesting  a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x series  i was looking forward to new seasons  in fact i still am  i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback  even after   yrs of it being cancelled  da can make it big if worked on properly  and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge',1

'unfortunately  spacecamp came out about the same time as the challenger explosion  which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should  bring it out  i m glad they did  i first watched spacecamp at a drive in movie  which really enhanced the viewing a lot while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt  i had never heard of the others in the movie  so  it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting  and acting real good  of course  kate capshaw was excellent too i especially liked the scenes  where those kids were being shown how to act  as a team  the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for  the actual launch of a spacecraft  is of course  old news to us  however  this one was different all in all  this is one of my most treasured films  escapist maybe  but it was fantastic for a space nut like me  after probably renting it for         times  i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it  now  if it only comes out on dvd  i will probably have it forever  this movie gets a   out of    from me',1

'i could see this film is super he didn t surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth  this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn t have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory  right very i liked watching this film when i was the child  i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really  certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense  who at healthy senses  sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit  i very like reading for the subject  american and soviet space programs  i know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by cia with the clause top secret certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows',1

'wow this film is the best living testament  i think  of what happened on         in nyc  compared to anything shown by the major media outlets those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside  this film shows you what happened on the inside it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman  waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight  the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers  you are then given a front row seat as firefighters rush to the scene  into the lobby of tower one in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane  and tower two s subsequent fall  you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby  it is a sight you will not soon forget heart rending  tear jerking  and very compelling from the first minute to the last         deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made we must never forget',1

'spoilers      is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc   french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it before      nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario  on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane this is the only footage of the first impact he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground this is the most grueling moment in the documentary then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york  because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody s memory i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of so this makes it even more realistic to watch',1

'amazing documentary  saw it on original airdate and on dvd a few times in the last few years  i was shocked that it wasn t even nominated for a best documentary oscar for       the year it was released  no other documentary even comes close it was on tv recently for the  th anniversary  but i missed the added  where are they now  segment at the end  except i did catch that tony now works for the hazmat unit i ve seen criticism on documentary film making from a few on this list  i can t see how this could have been done any different  they had less than   months to assemble this and get it on the air  the dvd contains more material and background i m also surprised that according to imdb com  the brother have had no projects in the four years since  what have they been doing',1

'it took us a couple of episodes to  get into  dark angel as a story and a series  since we were transitioning from the sopranos  a very different mentality framework  but  once we got with the gist of the series  we were very quickly hooked  it s a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category  dark angelwas much more than your average tv series  it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes  but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to  mutants  reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face  and make  everyday  that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces  hence not ruining the  fun  for those who don t like to be lectured during entertainment   but every event and human societal interaction remains relevant to the present  we all make judgments  face our own prejudices  but  in the end  the question of who you are lies in  do you sit back and shut your mind to it  or do you get up and do something about it  for those who have no choice but to fight  for survival or justice  this series empowers them  for those who ve never had to face the question  this series  sneaks in  that message under the guise of pure action entertainment  it is much more well made and well written than most tv series  i m highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear',1

'made by french brothers jules and giddeon naudet  and narrated by robert de niro and firefighter james hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new york s finest shone on it s darkest day  i first saw this when i was a young naive    year old  and at that age it still touched me  knowing how serious      really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of       we were finding out who the heroes were  how there everyday lives were composed  and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves  these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them  watch if you can this is the best documentary i have personally ever seen',1

'the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did  they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened  they were in building     when you could see papers drifting down  people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height i mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running  their camera was still running  when the white dust covered them  they found a shop doorway and got inside  but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us ten stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every      so i ll never forget what this country went through  i believe if i remember right  it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters  while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral',1

'difficult film to comment on  how do you say it s bad  well it isn t  but then it s equally difficult to say it is good  what it is  is compelling viewing  it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there  it is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of thailand brought to life  you know you want to turn away but you have to watch the naudet brothers handle the commentary very well  even in the most tragic of circumstances  there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults  the facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on you can t change history  and you should not want  this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour',1

'i ve read most of the comments here  i came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that      is a shocking piece of history  there are a few who think that the added narrative is weak andi agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary  about two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about tony  but i don t think narration is unnecessary  like i lot of theorists i think that our own lives are narrations  we are living and making our own autobiography  so if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration  we don t sum up facts like  birth  childhood  high school etc  we create a story about our live because we are familiar with stories  we want to put history in a story as well  because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves  we can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story  so that s the purpose of adding a story in documentary  the story is weak  so be it  but we understand whats going on  if it was me out there i would be worried sick about my brother and the second point  making a blockbuster movie about it  true  it s been to recent to come up with a big movie about       though  there have been a few about the subject  but none of them like this documentary  but what if there will be a movie in about   years  i agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of       but i also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history  how many movies about the world war   have we seen  if i had not seen these movies my view of the ww would me totally different  i remember seeing schindlers list  and i cried for an hour during class  movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties so my point  telling stories is not always bad  it makes us identify with the story  and makes us never forget what happened',1

'the events of september         do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers  in my view it would have been better to leave this out  i think the directors tried too hard  perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop  the comment of one of a policemen    this aint f   ing disneyworld  is apt nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events  the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times  no other footage from the day matches what they shot',1

'let me get the bad out of the way first  james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day  really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes  i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september   th  it is a second home to me and i can t help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city  this is the real deal  in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them  i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day  it is a shame that they didn t use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory  it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way',1

'i live in missouri  so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me  this brought it home  that two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of fdny and nypd did  just to document the horror that unfolded on that day  this film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings',1

'gdon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters  what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september    having worked with james hanlon s ladder company before  jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak  while gdon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened  an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules  and he pointed the camera up  seconds before the plane crashed into tower one jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers  the first thing he saw was two people on fire  something he refused to film  he stayed on site for the next several hours  filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there the brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent  grizzly  and gory  but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse  and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored  the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with one on one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis unlike a feature film of similar title  most of the money from dvd sales go to      related charities  very well made  emotional  moving  and completely devoid of political propaganda  is the best documentary of the sort to date',1

'i have to say that the events of      didn t hit me until i saw this documentary  it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation  i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers  i was sick of hearing about it  when this was aired on tv a year and a day later  i was bawling my eyes out  it was the first time i had cried since the attack  i highly recommend this documentary  i am watching it now on tv    years later  and i am still crying over the tragedies  the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing  it was an accident  and look where it got them  these two brothers make me want to have been there to help',1

'i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in       he was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding  i liked the way it was told as a  documentary   if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning       this would be the one  normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known  this movie had nobody known  also  you see a movie concerning       you hear about a fire fighter or two losing their lives saving people  i didn t feel this had any of that  i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection  very well done indeed  my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of',1

'dark angel rocks  the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off  me and my friends have gatherings to watch every da episode  takes like   days but it is worth it  it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me',1

'incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september   th  intense  personal  and completely riveting       is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident  which kind of gives it an even greater appeal  up until that morning  filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team  concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman  out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup  jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center  and from there a simple documentary was no more viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero  as the amazing group of fire fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster  without hesitation  naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it s entire support crumbles around them  the raw fear of an unknown  impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside  nearly as memorable is older brother gideon s candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed  by the time we get to see the second tower collapse  as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris  we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up close footage captured obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event  though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event  in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document  only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage  even if it cost them their own safety after viewing       and seeing that it came out in       i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone s recent rendition  the big budgeted world trade center  many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble  and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought       all but renders his film completely obsolete  not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day  but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again',1

'to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible  every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid fire images  through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero  but every frame is real  the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york  jules      and gideon      naudet  pronounced  nau day   want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters  beginning with a  newbie  from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full fledged firefighter  seeking the help of their close friend  actor james hanlon       an actor and firefighter at station    engine    the naudets sift through the  probies  at the academy and find one  tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close knit family  firefighters have a superstition about  probies   it is that they are either  white clouds  or  black clouds   meaning that with the latter  all kinds of fires follow the  probie   the former means that very little fire activity follows  but one day  there will be the mother of all fires  tony is a  white cloud   after some initial growing pains  tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet  then the unthinkable occurs    september          begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street  because jules has had little camera experience  gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief  t  k  pfeiffer  arriving at about       the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate  then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene  and as jules pans upwards  we see the first strike of the day  american airlines flight    smashes into the face of the north tower of   world trade  pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center  once there  jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower  pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him  once inside  the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area  once there  he captures the impact of the second plane  united airlines flight      with   world trade  he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers  watching and capturing the crowds  reaction to the unimaginable  gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan  inside tower one  jules records the last view the world  or loved ones will have of their sons  fathers  uncles  grandfathers  husbands  boyfriends  friends as one by one  each firefighter  carrying    lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up    stories to rescue the injured and trapped  jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother  kevin  as he leaves to do his selfless duty  also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones  sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke  but jules is respectful  never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment   the money shot  his work is professional through his baptism of fire  he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building  then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken  father michael judd  the chaplain for the fire department  then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two  tower one begins its structural collapse what results is a breathtakingly  poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day  not knowing if either is alive  each fearing the worst  as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse  they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back  and in one moment of overwhelming emotion  jules and gideon are reunited  as jules cries on his brother s shoulder  gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject  there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos  who left the station with a former chief  is believed to have been lost   but returns to the fold  this  probie  has proven himself shown with only three interruptions       is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking  it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds  the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject  in lesser hands  the tendency would be toward the sensational  but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion  narrated by hanlon  we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september     robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre  restrained way  he never seeks the camera for his own glory  rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see  i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special  chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings  they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished  this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is  it isn t about dribbling a basketball  or selling an album of hate lyrics        is about humanity at its best  heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom',1

'this was the most visually stunning  moving  amazing and incredible story i ve ever experienced  quite frankly  even those adjectives just cannot describe it  i can t just choose one scene that stood out for me  i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims  the reaction of people trapped in the elevator  who were unaware of what was going on  as they finally emerge to the horrific scene  the shock and disbelief of the onlookers  and finally the silence on that day  and even now  i am reminded of star wars         obi wan says   i felt a great disturbance in the force  as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced   it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description  there was truly a disturbance in the force this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance  the feelings are so incredibly visual  the anger  the frustration  the shock  the fear  the exhaustion  and the realization of its very magnitude  it s all there  not a thing is missed this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy  not just because it documents      but because it is simply everything it should be if you plan to watch  be sure to grab a box of tissues  you ll need them  i know that i did',1

'to those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed  i disagree  this is an amazing documentary about a shocking day imdb asks us to rate this movie  i beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made  the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable  we find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened  they continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother s safety  to judge whether it s nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing  amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer  i just know that in    years  a class full of children will not know one without the other i submit a wholehearted     this is why the art of filming was created  to capture the natural emotion that real life offers  you can keep your kung fu junk  romance is cute  action will never reach this level  this movie        will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself  it didn t have a sneak peek  it didn t have all of the blatant vanities that a lion s share of the many movies on the many screens blare  it had class  composure  substance  and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of america and even the world  it spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera  please consider this movie  as it itself proclaims  a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free  beautiful name of america how can you give anything less to a movie that shows  not embellishes  the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times  i love  the godfather  but        is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world  it is art without question or questions jf',1

'i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs  i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day  i was going to school at hunter college  i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again  but like many i was curious to see what this was all about  tears came to my eyes watching this documentary  all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable  i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times  how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible  if you have not seen this documentary  do yourself a favor and check it out  it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes  but it s an incredible document of this countries darkest hour',1

'great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time   that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item   what shocked me was not only the attacks  but the high fat diet  and physical appearance of some of these firefighters  i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that in the physical shape they were in  some of these firefighters would not of made it to the   th floor carrying over    lbs of gear  having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job  the french have a history of making great documentary s and that is what this is  a great documentary',1

'very interesting and moving documentary about the world trade center tragedy on   th september      the main theme of it is the heroism of american fire fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could the film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing many people seen on screen have lost their lives recommended',1

'warning  mild spoilers ahead    yes  i realize it s tough to spoil an historical documentary  but i do reveal some of the backstory and methods  this is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage  but also due to the story behind it  because the naudets did not set out to tell the story of       but rather that of a rookie firefighter  the men s emotions and the viewer s connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective in a filmmaking sense         is textbook  if the events were an actual script  they would be superb  as the characters are established  then thrown a curve to which they must react  this is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together the first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station  specifically  how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans  that part alone is quite good  and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course  it probably would have been solid  the brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a nyc firefighter then of course  all hell breaks loose  the chaos following the wtc attacks is vividly seen  as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations  seeing not only the attacks  but also the first hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion the aftermath  in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found  is human drama at its peak  life and death hang in the balance  unlike many movies  the viewer not only doesn t know who will live and die  but genuinely cares about them the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the robert deniro  whom i like  blurbs were uninformative  unnecessary  and didn t advance the story at all  they were probably added just to attract more television viewers bottom line  the best documentary i ve ever seen  nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama      out of',1

'is a classic example of cinema verite  a sort of realist documentary  in this case of new york firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history  it s all tiny  unobtrusive  hand held video cameras  often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming  and by the director  naudet s hand frequently wiping the screen  in this film  you get to know most of the firemen   tony benatatos  the rookie  or  probie   in ny fireman vernacular   the fire chief joseph pfeiffer  who finds he s lost his brother later on  and a few others  there are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film  just to emphasise the personal  reflexive nature of the events  the build up is quite dramatic and well done  particularly the passing out ceremony at the fire department  with a few useful swish pans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork  just like rob reiner s a few good men   tony looks proud the viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen  which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of wtc  while pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next   this is classic cinema verite  there is also the eery  haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside  it is then that an increasingly forlorn fire chief pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless   and this is before wtc  collapses  you have to give credit to naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which moment the sound of the neighbouring wtc  collapsing is so awfully sad  poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen  from the lobby  it looks  feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened  you hear an enormous rumbling  trembling maelstrom   like that of a giant  monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded   the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in wtc  are oblivious to this event  where is the communication this film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided   cues like  this really was a day like no other  or naudet s frequently banal pronouncements like  you could see fear in everybody s eyes  and  i knew tony was freaking out   the film is really just one long video diary  there are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone  imagine this film blended with cctv footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day  the effect would be greater  you could even combine this story with that of mayor giuliani and  perhaps  the famous cornishman rick riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the hero i don t see much of a propaganda element in this film  as some reviewers suggest  this film is no triumph of the will  by riefenstahl  some time later the firemen drape the american flag over a nearby  surviving building overlooking what has become ground zero  so what there are also some moments of dubious camerawork  for example  who is holding the camera when the two naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station  is it staged there is an excellent finish  very much in the traditon of the excellent french director alain resnais  hiroshima mon amour   with two strips of light reflected in the water  shimmying',1

'it s true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes  and none more so that september           a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism no  this documentary didn t set out to be dwelling on the events leading to       rather  the filmmakers  brothers gdon and jules naudet  set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter  they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training  and had handpicked their  proby   probation firefighter  to join them in an ny firehouse  home to ladder   and engine    but their production was to develop and contain at that time  believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming  and received a call at about    pm local time from my dad  who informed me of the above  few minutes later  he told me there was another  and that the wtc was under attack  by the time i arrived home  the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke  and to my horror  they collapsed  under an hour the filmmakers had two cameras running that day  one who had followed a team out on a routine call  and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it  we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc  where the first responders of firefighters  paramedics  and police had to make sense of what happened  and to quickly develop a plan of action  the other camera  held by the other brother  was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling  and along the journey  captured the many expressions of new yorkers  as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder   and engine    which miraculously  did not suffer any casualty  but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil  as they struggle to come to terms with the event  through the events that unfold  we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs  to save lives we began with what the documentary was supposed to be  before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus  right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures  it s not a film that is fabricated  and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary  and heavens  not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters   it s as close as you can get to that day  witnessing the event up close  from safety code   dvd contains a separate extra hour of   sets of interviews with the men of ladder   and engine',1

'i miss dark angel   i understand not ever one likes it  but as far as i m concerned the show should not have been canceled  especially for another space show mock up   i m reading the books now  they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings  but i still think we should get a tv movie or something the freak nation lives',1

'hosted by robert deniro  presents footage from outside and inside the twin towers in new york  on september          never too grisly and gory  yet powerful and moving         is a real treat  anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything     stars',1

'my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her  she s from china and only heard so much about      and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary  i felt awful watching this documentary  it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes but i m extremely grateful that i watched this documentary  because on the day of september   th  i m sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard  all of us could only think certain questions   why     how     what s going on     oh  my god    almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others  but i don t think we thought about what they were really going though  this wasn t actually supposed to be a documentary about       the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything  outside and in  on tape on sep    th  i thought to myself  it s ok  the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived   to be honest  i thought it was an accident  i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class  someone came into the locker room shouting  some building just got bombed in new york    we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv  not only    seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident  a few minutes later  we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down  so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking  what are the firemen and policemen going to do    but it s procedure to them i thought  they ll know what to do the first tower collapsed  we knew it  so many lives are now gone  the second tower crashed  things would never be the same  those firemen in this documentary showed courage  confusion  and strength  the real raw human emotions  they didn t know what to do  they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers  they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows  and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv  i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help  i know they feel like they were just doing their job  but they did more  they were hero s  every day after sep    th for   weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors  but they kept on hoping and praying  may god bless their kind and brave hearts as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks  she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day  she asked  why    i didn t know what to say  it breaks my heart that people can be that evil   it sounds clique   but it was a normal day for everyone  one of the firemen said in the documentary  no one expected this to happen  not like that  those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked  they were just doing their job  happen to be there  or even just was there for a second passing by  they were not just murdered  they were slaughtered  and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart  then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating  why do people do this  they celebrated death and the lose of  mothers  fathers  sisters  brothers  friends  grandparents  aunts  uncles  cousins  etc  why so  thanks to those people for making this documentary  you truly think about the firemen  policemen  and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world  thank you to all those people  you are our heroes',1

'i was one of many that expected to see a glorified  yankee doodle dandy portrayal of a day that  as famously quoted  should live in infamy  rather than glory  how wrong i was  these guys were there  right in the middle of it  and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking  and yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on september          two french filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a ny firefighter  particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks  at the beginning we see much of this footage  just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism  this was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others  and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge while investigating a suspect gas line  i think  my memory s a little hazy on that   we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead  the camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers  what must the cameraman have been thinking at this time  recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on  and possibly realizing the same thing  the fdny allow the camera to follow them into the building what follows is a true view from the front lines  we see the commitment of the fdny  their reactions  the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling  as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside  while a second camera captures the events from the outside if it wasn t for the horrific event they were covering  the footage alone would be any young doco maker s dream come true  quite simply  the footage deserves to be preserved for all time  but what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer  we see firefighters charging in without hesitation  people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another  they are brothers  as they cannot reach one another in the confusion  there are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film  something hollywood could never duplicate  even though it s trying       isn t a film about politics  nor is it a film about religion  nationality or even jihad for that matter       is a film about people  and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of       is quite simply one of the most important films i ve ever seen  and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me  you can t duplicate this',1

'i must admit that i was very sceptical about this documentary  i was expecting it to be the kind of all american propaganda that we here in europe dislike so much  i was wrong  this is not propaganda  in fact it is hardly political at all it depicts the events of      through the eyes of the firefighters called to the scene just after the planes crashed  it is an amazing coinsidence that this documentary was filmed at all  this film was initially shot as a documnetary about a rookie ny firefighter becoming  a man   we can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them a great piece of work  absolutely stunning material  highly recommended regards',1

'it s a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr  the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome  the guy is cute too so it s a good match if you want to the guy or the girls',1

'yowsa  if you really want some action  check out the babes and bombs on this non stop thriller  veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism    but director dean hamilton doesn t let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of teensy swimsuit scenes  jiggly beach jogs  hubba hubba hot tubs and the like  want action  you ll get more of it here than in pearl harbor  want babes  you ll get an eyeful every two minutes  want more  go out and buy this video  yowsa  yowsa  yowsa  that s some mighty spicy meatballs',1

'of course i would have to give this film    out of    as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime  rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over    years living in italy  he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing  so rodolfo sonego did  if you check out his biography  you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy  alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories  my uncle visited australia and my town  in      to check out locations for  a girl in australia  and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war  you can see his humor in all his movies  i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently  great',1

'i love monte carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie  i thought everyone was very good  i was not familiar with richard lewis  i thought he made his character  julian peters  very personable  funny and attractive  sean young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold  george hamilton was charming and the perfect italian gigolo  john candy has a field day as the bon vivant  james belushi is hysterical as a total jerk  cybill shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife  delightful ensemble cast  lots of talent  clever script  lots going on and beautiful locations  just a nice pick me up for a dreary day  especially in the winter when a trip to europe is not anywhere on your horizon',1

'super slick entertainment with a stellar cast  an outstanding script  and a firm grip on the approaching      s  at the time  rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens  but whatever the value of those shadowy downers  they reflected a war time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era  few films of the late    s are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy jim blandings  cary grant  works as an ad man on madison ave  where in his little daughter s words   he sells things to people that they don t need  at prices they can t afford  he s making good money  but like thousands of others  he s tired of living in a cramped urban  cave   so  with wife myrnah loy  they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside  needless to say  in the arms of nature  they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion there s hardly a lifeless line in the entire script  i don t know if writers panama and frank got an oscar  but they should have  of course  the humor revolves around all the problems that pop up when city people build a big house on rural land  the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage  with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time  of course  no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant  so it s just one well placed laugh after another  particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own  yet  oddly  the film appears to have no comedic high point  instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don t peak at any particular point  that s a real movie triumph for any era reaching back    years later  we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind  with their live in maid  the blandings may not be a typical american family  but that post war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical  and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an  ad man  tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more  ham   more than anything  however  there s the movie s sunny optimism  oh sure  the feeling falters at times  yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through  indeed  life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge  so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day  it s that easily over looked subtext  along with the sheer entertainment value  that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post war period so  if you haven t seen it  catch it next time around',1

'this movie has an all star cast  john candy  richard lewis  ornella mutti  cybill shepard  and jim belushi to name a few  run amuck in monte carlo  as well as some other beautiful european locations  and is very funny  the trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great  and i highly recommend that you see this movie  it is well worth it  john candy is in top form in once upon a crime  as is everyone else  if you and your family are looking for a great family film  this is your ticket  everyone gives stellar performances  great acting  great comedy  and great timing  which is rare in movies these days  great plot  great mystery   which i love anyways  and overall  well worth the money you spend on it  so get the kids  grab some popcorn  juice  or tea  or sodas  and enjoy the show',1

'john candy s performance in once upon a crime is possibly his best ever  it s been my favourite movie since it came out  i spent   years searching for it  that s how good it is  if you disagree  well  that s your opinion  enjoy the movie',1

'i would reccomend this film to everyone  not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue  but to all film buffs  because it s sincere  moving  funny and true  because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover  and every frame of his film is made with love and care  because his characters are loved and ask to be loved  because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one  done by an outsider  is a real joy to watch and to listen at  because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza  who was  like freccia  beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin  that ligabue shows as it is  unglamorous and ugly  without indulging in easy moralisms  because it s a film that speaks to our heart  our ears  our souls  and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that  thanks  luciano',1

'about the importance of being young  having friends  and most of all enjoying life  through the experience of four friends  ligabue shows to the audience how life was back in the    s in a small italian village  the four carachters represent the four different aspects of human behavior  also the drug experience is well represented',1

'nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the    s and    s  radiofreccia describes a generation  it describes life in a small village near correggio  hometown of ligabue  the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie   it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world  it reminds of trainspotting  with a bit of italian touch',1

'radiofreccia  is still a good surprise in italian cinema  the film is based on a book of italian songwriter luciano ligabue  who also directs the movie and writes the music score  of course the film is a portrait of north italian province life  in the emilia romagna region  we re in       the time of the first free radios  one of the boys of the movie creates  radioraptus   youth wishes  friendship  love  sex  individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes  but the film speaks also about drugs  freccia  the main character  is a victim of heroin slavery without being boring and moralist  the story flows very well  the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well  obviously luciano  liga  ligabue is neither fellini nor a movie professional  first of all he s a musician  but he succeeds in making a good product  unfortunately he ll not repeat the success with his second movie  da zero a dieci   not good at all in  radiofreccia  actors are generally not very famous  the only star is stefano accorsi  one of the most popular young italian actors  see in a small role another italian songwriter  francesco guccini  he s the nice communist barman and football trainer',1

'radiofreccia is a movie about all of us  about our dreams  our friends  our obsessions  our addictions  our fears  it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century  the movie doesn t take a happy or sad approach on things  it just tells us a story  one that all of us could have experienced  one of happiness and excitement  sadness and grief  the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters  it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again  feeling closer to the little town in emilia romagna where it takes place  hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to freccia and his friends  listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing radio raptus international  playing their dreams  our dreams  radiofreccia will make you laugh  it will make you cry at times  it will shock you and comfort you  it will give you and take from you  personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life  and that of my friends  and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours',1

'now this show looks like most of the other shows of it s type from the mid    s  but the only thing is about this one is that it s different  they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too  i personally thought it was a good show  i can t understand why would they cancel it  the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since      up to date my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie  which i know is gonna be impossible to do  but hey it doesn t hurt to dream  doesn t it anyway  i would recommend if you hadn t seen it to find the dvd of all    episodes  because the characters are great  the story lines are good  the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great',1

'a classic cartoon  always enjoyable and funny  it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters  road rovers is a show worth seeing  it is a short    episodes  and if you can ever manage a chance to see it  you should  unfortunately  it is very hard to find  i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all    episodes  i would definitely buy it if they did  and if they do  you should buy it too  if you have kids who like dogs  they will love road rovers  road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired  it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was',1

'this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes  the money pit and are we done yet   only points out all the more how the    s movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since  regretfully  been lost i was    when i first saw this and even at that tender age  there was much i could laugh at  now of course being familiar with adult frustrations  i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth the three main actors   cary grant  myrna loy  and melvyn douglas   interacted perfectly  but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream  it s never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions all in all  this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it',1

'far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did  after animaniacs  even if the ratings were low  so what  i still enjoyed it and loved it  was so funny and i adored the cast  wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic  the whole cast were brilliant  especially the legendary frank welker i d love to see this cartoon again  was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant  also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it  you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental  that was just fantastic  i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in  i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back  i loved them',1

'the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world  the show was hilarious to say the least  simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages  running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game  the action was mesmerizing  and cleverly set up  the characters were very original  each with a very different personality  but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters  each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed  but implied in subtext  hopefully  one day  there ll be some way to watch the rovers in action again',1

'i enjoyed this movie  haven t seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly  i ve associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he s versatile i wasn t troubled that dotty s  anxiety disorder  may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook  there are zillions of whatever phobias and neuroses  and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms  she is clearly a sensitive with extra sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos  it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric although this is taken to be a light  family movie   it is actually more sophisticated than it seems  also  hiram s twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle  it s fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance',1

'though not in the whole film  andy griffith again plays his role best in this cbs tv movie  the plot is easy griffith s character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named  mountains somewhere   though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video  if you do get the chance to watch this  take it',1

'i saw that when i was little and it was excellent  kelsey white as lisa and the meecy mices where cute  susan bonde as doodle and sandra dee heidecke as snoodle where hilarius  karen boettcher tate as profster was interesting  burl ross as little bunny foo foo was funny  gregory donavon as kaiso was brilliant  whats hilarius that snoodle and doodle eat too much candy  whats sad that little bunny foo foo that bops the meecy mices on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny foo foo few wishes then he turns into goon  this story is about when lisa  snoodle  doodle go to the big rock candy mountains  this show is excellent the kids will like this show  new words  songs  and watching them playing',1

'so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it  we would watch it all the time  when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we d watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa s magical toys  i m    now and i still love this movie  some old friends and i recently got together and watched it  we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little  one friend actually bought this movie and grandpa s magical toys for her   year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie  this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe  no violence  no bad language  just lots of great songs and important lessons',1

'big rock candy mountain is amazing  i watched it when i was little  and still do to this day  senior in high school   if i could imagine heaven  that is what it would look like  i wish i could live in big rock candy mountain where candy grows on trees  zach hyman is profs  and my best friend  little bunny foo foo is the man  it is so fuzzy and colorful that i dream about it at night  in fact  my friend who is    recently watched it for the first time and absolutely loved it  i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie  i am having a huge party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie  we are going to order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle  i constantly find myself watching clouds and wishing i was that little girl that got to visit  thanks  bye',1

'when i was little  my parents got this movie for me to watch  i really liked it  and i watched it over and over again  even when i was in  rd grade i still watched it from time to time  recently  i watched it again  just for the sake of nostalgia  and though the show was not aimed for my age group  i m in my late teens   i still found it entertaining and educational  this show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others  some parts i found quite entertaining  also  this show does not have any bad content  so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot  i would recommend this',1

'there are a few spoilers in this comment  contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex u and a few others  i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i ll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little  the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed  i do fail to see how that many  professionals  weren t able to hit a moving target  but the action was definitely there and deke  being the hero  had to survive as for the comment about needing to  get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs   this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of       a good   months before the terrorist attacks against the u s if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it  maybe they would have realized the plot of the story  rashid  a bin laden like character  planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states  the president s man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it',1

'i ve always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film  although the acting may not be superb  the fight scenes are fantastic  i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him  in my opinion  the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production  i hope you take the time to view this movie',1

'if you re a a fan of either or both chuck norris   judson mills then this is the movie to see it has a lot of adventure in it it is a great follow up to president s man the chemistry between the main three stars chuck norris judson mills jennifer tung is incredible my personal opinion this movie along with the original has turned out so well that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series if you ve seen president s man i recommend this movie for you if you ve seen president s man a line in the sand but you haven t seen president s man then let me suggest that you do you will not be disappointed with either one',1

'lars von triers europa is an extremely good film  how s that  von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story  at least he did have with europa  to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen  even with all the tricks  in my opinion  this film is the most complete  real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top     list  i also think it is perhaps the scariest  the most gothic and complete film around  all right there are other good ones too  but this one is my favorite  the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever',1

'this movie is far better than the original the jerk  i would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor  we have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from monty python the card game with the hobos and then with mr  suicide  the scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup  the original the jerk was too choreographed ans staged  while i like steve martin  he seemed like he was trying to hard  the jerk too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone  the jerk too is family friendly unlike the original the jerk',1

'honestly  when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off  as i sat there for the next    minutes or so  i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show  his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasn t been in more comedies  he has this  marty feldman  thing going for him but much  much more talent   taking nothing away from marty  the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk  but then again  it was so much more  i really think that if this movie was released first  and i saw the steve martin movie  nd  i d think the  nd was a cheap rip off  i know it sounds like a bold statement  but it s true  i actually like steve martin a great deal  but his performance is  nd to the actor in the jerk too  i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection  i urge you to see it if you can find it',1

'i m on the opposite end of the previous comment first of all  i don t think this was intended to be a straight sequel to  the jerk   i mean  it s not titled  the jerk       it s  the jerk  too   which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same  it actually revolves around a completely different person think about it  virtually no connection to the previous movie  other than character names  a totally different story  different cast  and the fact that it s a partial musical i say give this movie some credit  it does have plenty of laughs in it   mark blankfield at his prime',1

'i don t understand  not being a critic  i am not evaluating the quality of the acting  which i find believable  a good thing  my confusion lies with the content  is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country  should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so  what effect their cheating  wives   infidelity had on them  while these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness  did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily  they didn t think of their husbands at all  only of themselves  pardon me  except when they wished their husbands dead',1

'stuck in a hotel in kuwait  i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning  first pachelbel s canon brought a lump to my throat  then the sight of a tiger moth  which my grandfather  my father and i have all flown  produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowe s name hooked me completely  i was entranced by this film  crowe s performance  again   the subject matter  and yes  what a debt we owe   how various matters were addressed and dealt with  the flying sequences  my father flew avro ansons  too   the story   and  as another contributor pointed out  crowe s recitation of high flight  i won t spoil the film for anyone  but  separated from my wife by       odd miles  as an ex army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot  i admit to crying heartily a couple of times  buy it  rent it  download it  beg  borrow or steal it   but watch it ps did i spy a bristol blenheim  in yellow training colours on the ground  looked like a twin engine aircraft with a twin      brownings in a dorsal turret',1

'i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched  that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents  attempting to make sense of a world at war  the ending and use of pachabel s cannon are both amazing',1

'i felt this film   throughout  i waas impressed with russell crowe s talent in developing his relationship with lillie  such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach  a bit self depreciating and very persistent  really loved the cinematography and direction  pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive gosh  didn t russell s talent even in      shine     and i have yet to see gladiator',1

'i have just seen this film  and fallen in love with it  there is a little bit of something for everyone  and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between lachlan and lil  when they are on the beach  i nearly cried    there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together  this idea taken from several angles  from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places  the film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last  crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of lachlan  i ve always had a soft spot for the accent  but i nearly melted with his portrayal of his character  the way this film was shot is also beautiful  with the music  backdrop of the open fields  and superb acting  all together  this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions',1

'i enjoyed every moment of this movie  even though i knew they could never really be together  with the life expectancy of a bomber pilot being only six weeks  it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the      s who must have lived this story',1

'russell  my fav  is gorgeous in this film  but more than that  the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow  everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected  the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity  fabulous love story between lachlin and lil  i replay their scenes over and over again  anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people  all characters are cast and portrayed excellently',1

'movie  comedies  nowadays are generally     minutes of toilet humor  foul language  and groin kicking  modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator  the undemanding and slow of brain  sure  an occasional good comedy will come along  but they re becoming rarer all the time  mr  blandings buildings his dream house  shows what     s hollywood was capable of  and it s just screamingly funny  jim and muriel blandings  cary grant and myrna loy  decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs  the film follows their story  beginning with house hunting trips  the house s riotous construction  all the way to the finished home  with its  zuzz zuzz water softener  grant and loy are perfect for their roles  of course  grant is particularly funny as he watches the house s costs zoom out of control   however  the film is stolen by the blandings  wise attorney  played to perfection by melvyn douglas  managing to steal every scene he s in  douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis  reginald denny as the blandings  harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful i ve watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh  i think it s a good film to watch when you need a lift  whether you re building a house or not',1

'very nicely done movie  it does stay in your memory  better billed as a romance than flying or war  altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free  flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes  unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love fun watching early crowe  he is good and exudes charm  his reading of  high flight  is superb cheers  boom',1

'japanese tomo akiyama s keko mask        is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch  there are also some sequels  but i haven t seen them since these films are hyper rare  some kind of re releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films  the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline  which is  according to the teachers  the most important thing in education  the school is lead by incredibly funny looking  just look at the costume   human wizard whatever  who is like principal in the school  and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed  well  the main thing about the film is its name  keko mask  who is some beautiful and masked fairy  who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers  yes  this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background  the most important thing is  of course  that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked  her identity is never revealed in these films  and also the credits say  keko mask  unknown  while the actor names are listed the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies  she has a gorgeous  but lethal vagina  yes  you read right  she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them  spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view  after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs  the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like   i ve never seen such a beautiful vagina  and  now i can die in peace   this film is totally fantastic  there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films  japanese censors optically fog blur all the pubic hair in any film  and also about some restrictions among school students  like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc   there s one great scene in which one nerd sees girl s bare you know what for the first time  and says  hey there s no fog in it   i couldn t help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this  also  one character says in the end that he will return  if japan films allows to make the sequel  i m glad it allowed as i ve heard the sequels are equally outrageous  one sequel should include blues brothers  yes  those blues brothers   in it etc this is trash in its most enjoyable  funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find  this would definitely be even greater experience  if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point  but fortunately those segments are very few  this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don t mention here and it wouldn t be even necessary to tell them all here  if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek  i think you ll love this little gem as i do  and the director is definitely a genius in this field       perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal',1

'i turned this on to see the incredible ethel waters  whose autobiography i am now reading  i ll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in  but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece  it s pretty much a short film made by blacks  for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time  old trends exaggerated for humor  we see modern black movies do the same thing  but with the new trends  stereotypes    ho s  and the  hood  and such  i think if you look back in eighty years  you would find today s movies will look just as racist  what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the pint sized sammy davis jr   who out taps his contemporary  shirley temple  and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult  everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it  why not enjoy it for what it is  instead of what you think it should have been',1

'now  many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title  if you do not have the stomach for gory movies  then what are you doing reading this review  anyhow  i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately  this movie is chock full of wonderful gore  plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience  if you re a lover of good quality experiences  then by all means  watch this great flick',1

'no  this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance  but it is brilliant in its own right  you have to look at it for what it is  a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a    inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride  those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden  gem  as they say and just didn t quite get there  i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the    cent baby attached to a fish pole  hahaha  well  yes  i don t think a movie with a budget like this could afford  good  actors or effects so they worked with what they had  the guts and entrails were actually very convincing  the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall  this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesn t follow any trend or predictability  very good for a laugh',1

'well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen  the effects are so bad you just have to laugh  and the acting  well lets say its no mel gibson  but gary browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad  he becomes good  i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a     you must see it if your in to horror slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time  killer movie',1

'why does this have such a low rating  i really don t get it    is it because of the bad acting  the bad dialogue  well  who cares about these things in cheesy low budget horror movies  seriously  the acting and the dialogue isn t important in those movies  people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn t be allowed to rate cheesy low budget movies  those movies shouldn t be taken seriously  period anyway  time to talk about the movie  right  well  i loved it  i bought it because i expected a gorefest  but it s not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad  most of the time it s just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that s lame   but i didn t really care because the movie is hilarious  the characters are hilarious  the acting is hilarious  bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies   the dialogue is hilarious  bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies   the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious  the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on  but i don t want to say too much    but i have to mention that there s a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it s alive lol  oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol best lines in the movie detective manners   sniffs coke  detective sloane  what the  beep  are you doing  manners  what the hell did you snort  what the hell is that  detective manners  it s nothing man  it s    ehh    cold medicine   detective manners   injects heroin in his arm  detective sloane  what the  beep  are you doing  manners  are you  beep  insane  detective manners  it s cold medicine detective manners   repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face  detective sloane  what the hell s going on  manners  what are you doing  detective manners  this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock  he just started smashing his head on the rock  i think he s on pcp or something lol',1

'i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating  because i wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds  as a matter of fact  they didn t   at least  so its seems  some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie   that s it  this is what the majority of viewers think  however  the surprise comes at the end  and unfortunately then  when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie  i was also astonished when i saw that the brazilian portuguese title of this movie means  voyage into death   this is the spoiler that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat  on reasons that are completely unclear   you understand only in the last   minutes  when you start the movie with the english title  haunted boat  in your head  you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the  ghosts   but in reality  this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality  it is told from the perspective of the young girl  we see her not alone  but together with the four friends because she sees them  we do not see that she is alone  so  the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture stream  but the main story  we have at least two parallel worlds  the world in which the girl is and the world in which the   friends are  an intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie  the movie makers  cheated  an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film student elaborate with hastily  chosen  pseudo actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers  how mistaken can one be  but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes  the end that follows gives another surprise  the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat  when she has recovered from her shock  she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends  and there they are again  they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore  she jumps into the water  arrives at the boat   and they are away  miraculously beautiful  it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a rhetoromance writer  when i awoke  i saw death standing at my bed  but i closed my eyes  when i opened them again   he was gone',1

'i also saw this upon its release in      and have been struck since then with its final scene  if this is an answer to  high noon   then it s an apt and apposite response  the notion that  as this string is headed   the town comes together  is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of  high noon   in this theme   concho  is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all time favorites   the magnificent seven   both sinatra and conrad give impressive and convincing performances  especially sinatra s transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior  i can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years i ve inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves',1

'i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england  i ve seen hundreds of films since but i ve never forgotten this one although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character he was excellent in the role a lot of people seem to think that he did nt really come into his own until his role in  from here to eternity  but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad i d never see or heard of him before this film  conrad plays a terrific part in this film i remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character also i remember the music  that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again  it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth  i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color  i remember sinatra s blue shirt',1

'i ve always liked johnny concho and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd  frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one when we first meet frank in the film s title role  he s the brother of a notorious gunfighter who s out of town at the moment  the brother strikes terror in the heart s of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow  only phyllis kirk has any feeling for him  she s the daughter of storekeeper wallace ford and dorothy adams two other gunmen arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatra s brother and he s coming to his town to take over  they humiliate sinatra and run him out of town  kirk follows him overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone  it s a well acted performance  almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm  pity for some reason this has not been seen for years two other performances of note are keenan wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark  and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen  he s a villain of incredible malevolence  pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen however what i like about johnny concho is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with  let s just say i believe johnny concho was mgm s answer to high noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order',1

'still crazy  is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time  it has been erroneously compared to  this is spinal tap   which it has no relation to   spinal tap  is a satire  and  quite frankly  not a very good one  in spite of it s  outing  of many rock clichs   unlike  tap    still crazy  is populated by great actors  great songs and great human situations  you care about the people in  still crazy   that s all that matters  oh  yeah  the music s pretty damn good  too  written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze  american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea  the crying game   but would only later become familiar with bill nighy  underworld  love actually  pirates of the caribbean ii  and timothy spall  the harry potter movies',1

'i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm  happy feeling  i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time  i thoroughly enjoyed this film  the acting was superb  although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance  bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films  timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance  and billy connolly  as always  totally gorgeous  it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned  such a refreshing experience to see a well written  superbly acted and good looking movie',1

'still crazy has been compared to the spinal tap since both are comedies about wash up r r  groups  actually  here the similarity ends because still crazy is much better written and acted out  whereas spinal tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first    min into a drivel that makes beavis and butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison  still crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie  people who expect spinal tap like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light hearted nature of the movie  but i d take a successful self ironic romp of still crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is spinal tap',1

'i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years  a successful band from the    s decide to give it another try  they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues  with hilarious results  the music is fantastic  the script and acting are terrific  the characters are spot on  especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice  makeup and personality problems  the concert at the end was unreal  go and see it  preferably in a cinema with a good sound system',1

'if you like deep purple  you will enjoy in this excellent movie with stephen rea in main role  the story is about the most famous rock group back there in   s  strange fruits  and they decided to play together again  but  of course  there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts  jimmy nail and bill nighy are great  and song  the flame still burns  is perfect  you have to watch it',1

'this movie maked me cry at the end  i watch at least     movies a week  i seen loads of great movies  even more crap   ones  but when ending scene   catharsic at it s core   came i cried  and if you didn t   you have serious problems  the story is archetypal   nothing new or original  but it s real   because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist  glam isn t my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early    s    at some point this directed me toward velvet goldmine  docudramas never really work very good  but this movie really meked us believe it all   because they don t try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts  present musicians that are superheroes  groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb  they don t glorify drugs and alcohol  they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even    years late    once again great movie  since  leaving las vegas  i was never so moved by a movie',1

'i love this movie  it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging  congratulations   i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves  it is so eerie  you feel like you are watching a real life band  i would like to see more movies like this  i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked  and even if billy connolly is quite well known  he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it  congratulations again  i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy  and when you get to the final scene      well what can i say',1

'i thought this movie was fantastic  it was hilarious  kinda reminded me of spinal tap  this is a must see for any fan of    s rock   i hope me and my friends aren t like that in twenty years  bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together  but not succeeding well if you love music  and were ever in a band  this movie is definitely for you  you won t regret seeing this movie  i know i don t  even my family found it funny  and that s saying something',1

'as an aging rocker  this movie mentions heep and quo   my   favourite bands ever   but with the incredible cast  everyone    and the fantastic storyline   i just love this piece of creative genius  i cannot recommend it more highly   and mick jones added so much  foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever   lou gramm    i have watched this great work more than    times  bill nighy   what a voice   and jimmy nail   talent oozes from every pore   then astrid     and karen      what more could an aging rocker ask for           bloody brilliant alastair  perth  western oz  originally from windsor  england',1

'i agree with what  veinbreaker  wrote with regards to the  ahhhh  feeling you get at the end of this movie  i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film  the songs were well written and interesting  especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings  it s trippy  nighy was fab in his role  nail  nailed  it  beano was the typical drummer  and rea kept it together  bruce robinson was awesome  helena was a lovely girlfriend  but i felt juliet aubrey s performance was gorgeous  the scenes between aubrey   robinson killed me  perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on  too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out  they ought to i ve told all my musician friends  great quote by jimmy nail s character   it s supposed to be rock   roll  not the phantom of the f     g opera',1

'i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it  my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever since the plot has been well discussed  so no need in going over it again  the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings  americans  especially  aren t going to get all the jokes the first time around  i know i didn t this movie is funny  touching  sad   all at the same time  when ray proposes the toast at his daughter s wedding  it s cringe inducing  when karen calls tony  brian  as he attempts to kiss her  it s heartbreaking  when beano is finally cornered by the woman in black  it s too funny for words and the music  it s as good as any movie soundtrack i ve heard in years  i was dancing in the living room to  all over the world  every performance is absolutely perfect  bill nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of ray  a man who has had one too many bad trips  stephen rea is perfect as tony  the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years  he has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him  but all the actors are equally brilliant ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it  it s a gem',1

'another example of the unique talents of cary grant  a performance worthy of oscar consideration  yet once again shunned by the academy  mr  grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city  the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis  loosely  for the more modern tom hanks vehicle   the money pit  if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex  this movie is a must see',1

'in the voice over which begins the film  hughie billy connolly   a roadie for the great    s band strange fruit  said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop strange fruit s set was that god was sick of    s excess  indeed  it s been popular to put down that era of music  and see punk as a welcome antidote to it  while i agree the excess was tiresome as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it   and like punk  i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock  and this film about strange fruit s long  strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days one of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes  brian gibson directed what s love got to do with it  about tina turner while i had problems with the dramatic parts of the film  the music was handled very well   writers dick clement and ian le frenais co wrote the commitments and were behind the music oriented british tv show over the rainbow  and the songs strange fruit played were co written by foreigner s mick jones not to be confused with the clash s mick jones   so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about  also  two cast members are musicians in their own right bill nye i don t know about  though the film credits him with his own singing  and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era  while jimmy nail was in another british tv show which was music oriented  though i forget the name  and he was in evita   and the others are convincing at it  and while  as i said  a lot of    s bands like strange fruit behaved badly towards women  the movie doesn t make the same mistake except for the woman who follows timothy spall around   as the manager of the reunion  juliet aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character the other actors are all good as well  with special praise to stephen rea  who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality  there are a couple of plot points which don t work  but overall this is quite enjoyable  oh yeah  and the music is good too',1

'if you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening  this is the film for you  excellent script and perfectly cast actors  i especially loved ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs   inspired',1

'this reminded me of spinal tap  on a more serious level  it s the story of a band doing a reunion tour  but things are not harmonious between them  i was especially impressed with the performance of bill nighy as ray  you felt sorry for him  yet he had a certain creepiness about him  it s a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly old and pathetic bittersweet  highly recommended',1

'contrary to most reviews i ve read  i didn t feel this followed any of the other rock movies   spinal tap   etc   the story was more unique  although i feel most people wanted to see the  sex  drugs   rock and roll  vices that the band kept alluding to   as an american  i knew a few of the actors   spall  connelly   rea  surprised to find out  brian  bruce robinson was in zifferedi s     the flame still burns    my wife  who hails from mexico  didn t follow the english british language too well  missed some of the jokes  which i dutifully explained  but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene  she loves the song so much now   funny that amazon com has the soundtrack for     usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal mart for      usd  price non withstanding  i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since',1

'this series could very well be the best britcom ever  and that is saying a great deal  considering the competitors  fawlty towers  good neighbours  to name just two  what made butterflies so superior  even to the best of the best  is that it did not just exemplify great  classic  classy and intelligent comedy  but it also expanded horizons  reflecting   flawlessly  gently  and at every detail   the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it  the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself  this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones  and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time  then there were the decors  shop fronts  cars  these people   even the layabout sons  with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor   were sophisticated  they were examples of the  new europeans  that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade      s  of course  the premise was strange and fantastic  the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary  particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things  sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv  but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro   and  if the premise was not surprising enough  the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme  a potential affair that was not really about sex  or even romance  butterflies dazzled many  but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief    at the time anyway butterflies turned out to be   in so many ways   prophetic  it documented  ahead of its time   post modern ennui  all pervasive lifestyle  the notion of emotional infidelity  and generational disconnect and male discontent  portrayed perfectly by the strained father son relationships   it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way  and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place  and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come',1

'looking back over the past    years  since my first exposure to the show   all i can say is  once you get it it will stay with you forever  i remember my initial reaction being     annoyingly overacted    under produced    unlikeable characterswell  two years later i watched some episodes again and didn t find it nearly as annoying  a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it s bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness  yes  the show has a style that is not for everybody  and i m sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now  but  i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times   btw i am a married man    for all who think this is a show for females',1

'british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types  the quiet  introspective  usually romantic study and the farcical social satire  settings  characters  and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories  butterflies is perhaps the epitom of the first type the scripts are very verbal  including long interior monologues by the main character ria  a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life  when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman  who makes his interest in her quite clear   she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered the acting and scripts are always on the money  which makes one s reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one  i was neither blown away by it nor turned off  my mother  on the other hand  adored this show  i think the degree to which one identifies with ria s dilemma is the most important factor in determining one s reaction to butterflies',1

'johny to makes here one of his best style exercises  making a strong film with a good yakuza s story  the election of the new yakuza s boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context  making a very strong gangs film  i specially love the way he tells the history  moving around all the roles inside the yakuza s family  and making that we see the violence  like the only way they have to solve their problems   talking about  the technical aspects  the film is a good example of paused  rythmic and planified way of shooting a film  one of the hong kong films of the year  is like infernal affairs  but without the easy action violence scenes  and the confused storyline  strongly recommended to all asian films lovers  sorry for my english  better do in spanish lol',1

'enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama  the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man  no doubt representing modern society  i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long  i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie  the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest  on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce  yes sir  and  sorry  into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone  they are still there',1

'election is a chinese mob movie  or triads in this case  every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader  and at first it seems a toss up between big d  tony leung ka fai  or as i know him   the other tony leung   and lok  simon yam  who was judge in full contact    though once lok wins  big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader  unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters  this one is not an action movie  it has its bloody moments  when necessary  as in goodfellas  but it s basically just a really effective drama  there are a lot of characters  which is really hard to keep track of  but i think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit  a     year old baton  which is the symbol of power i mentioned before  changes hands several times before things settle down  and though it may appear that the film ends at the    or    minute mark  there are still a couple big surprises waiting  simon yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture election was quite the award winner at last year s hong kong film awards  winning for best actor  tony leung   best picture  best director  johnny to  who did heroic trio     and best screenplay  it also had nominations for cinematography  editing  film score  which i loved   and three more acting performances  including yam',1

'first off  i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence  i say unfortunately  because after seeing election   first  election seems a bit of a disappointment  both films are gangster epics that are similar in form  and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema    it s just not nearly as good as it s sequel in the first election installment  we are shown the two competitors for chairman  big d and lok  after a few scenes of discussion amongst the  uncle s  as to who should have the chairman title  they  almost unanimously  decide that lok  simon yam  will helm the triads  suffice to say this doesn t go over very well with competitor big d  tony leung ka fai  and in a bid to influence the takeover  big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side  this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war  lok is determined to become chairman but won t become official until he can recover the  dragon head baton   a material representation of the chairman s power  the current chairman  whistle  chung wang  has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton  as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides  which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election  which involves an underling named jet  nick cheung   a machete  and lots of bad guys  nick cheung s presence is attention grabbing to say the least    i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election  as he does deliver more of jet s character in the sequel while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance  i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film s actors  election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting  simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo  tony leung ka fai  and the under appreciated suet lam  there really aren t any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they re watching real gangsters although the performances are great  one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to s eye for the camera  there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots  as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles  all of which makes election  above all  a great looking film my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election  it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren t integral to the plot  while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates  the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles  underlings  and police officers crowding the storyline  maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad  or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more bottom line  all in all  this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast  excellent direction  and leisurely pacing that packs a punch  it s just a little more complicated than it needed to be',1

'it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films  but i think it s the best way to give an approximation of the place election occupies in the gangster genre arena  it works somewhere in between the godfather and kinji fukasaku s yakuza opus the yakuza papers  aka battles without honour and humanity   in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic  dark and gritty  but it s also a johnnie to film  and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur every two years the hk triad elects a new boss  only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the triads and the police  that s the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that  as in the yakuza papers  there s a great deal of scheming  back stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances  sometimes all it takes is a phone call   in one of the most memorable scenes i ve seen in recent time  which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict  fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect  election is not as action oriented as one might expect  although it is violent  and i m not talking about the glossy  glamour version of hollywood violence  this is dark and grim  to s camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims  after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not if you re familiar with to s style  then you should know what to expect  the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate  the cinematography is great  slick and dark in equal measures  utilizing dark hues  brown  dark green and orange  while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it  in the end  election occupies a peculiar place  it s not exactly a character study and it s not an action oriented gangster film  it explores a situation  the election and its aftermath   but does so in style  and is both realistic and romanticized  the triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental godfather',1

'i always thought this would be a long and boring talking heads flick full of static interior takes  dude  i was wrong   election  is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller drama  taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads rituals  characters are constantly on the move  and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider  it s still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters  furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light shadow contrasts  although there s hardly any action  the ending is still shocking in it s ruthless depicting of brutality  cool movie that deserves more attention  and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit',1

'personally  i find the movie to be quite a good watch  it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized not only that  it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don t just go all out and wipe out triads overall  the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings   torture  nevertheless  the movie stays true to the real world  thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens i d recommend this movie to any triad mafia movie fan  another good watch would be dragon squad  that movie has more guns than this  as in this movie there s more knives than guns  in fact i don t remember seeing a single gun',1

'this film really deserves more recognition than its getting  it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties  favours and allegiances within the crime world  the film is shot beautifully and delves into all you re classic crime themes such as betrayal and power  this film is a movie goers film  it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end  it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting  martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china  it features an arrangement of great characters  actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film  all in all      great plot characters but there are characters that don t stand out enough and the music didn t really get me going and at times i felt it didn t sync well with the action there is action by the way  so it loses some points for that',1

'i must admit  i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of  cut  last night  though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem  i am a true horror fan as true as they come  and found  cut  to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced  but one of the great parody comedy films of late my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements   the film was not overly clever in it s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could  i am certain this was intended as humour    hoping this was intended as humour and of course  there was the gore the use of the  customised  garden shears was brilliance   besides the expected stabs and slashes  in short  there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths  enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth the appearance of both kylie minogue  short that her appearance was  and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film   both performances were fantastic  as well as simon bossell   the castle   in a brilliant role as the jokey technician all in all  i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years  as well as a beautiful satire parody   toungue in cheek till the very end loved it  go see it',1

'australia s first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang  and a stab  and a slice  and a scream or two  and plenty of blood  frights  red herrings and lots of laughs in fact  there s lots of first surrounding cut   it s the first script of dave warner s to be produced  although he has several others either optioned or in negotiation  it s the first major film from director and former hoodoo guru kimble rendall  and it s also the first film for producer martin fabinyi  and for a bunch of guys dipping their toes into this genre for the first time  they sure know their stuff cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film students who hear about a slasher film  hot blooded  that was never finished because its director  hilary  kylie minogue   was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film despite their lecturer  who was assistant director on the night hilary died  warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dies  director raffy  jessica napier  and producer hester  sarah kants  decide to go ahead and complete the film  they put together a crew and manage to get the original star  vanessa turnbill  molly ringwald   to return to australia   in fact  to the original location   to complete hot blooded     years after shooting shut down of course  this being a slasher film  lots of bloodletting ensues  long with plenty of laughs  a few good scares and a rocking aussie soundtrack  cut shows that australia can make a good  mass market horror film just as well as hollywood it s a finely crafted feature  with excellent special effects  a taut plot and a killer   scarman   that s a welcome addition to the ranks of michael  jason and freddy',1

'i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was  the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was  well that was because it isn t supposed to be taken so seriously  basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job   there seems to be another movie coming out like that too  umm    scary movie   well this is aussie  and original    jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting  i hope to see more of them  molly ringwald was a good move  and kylie was an even better move  the impossible princess was queen of the screen   i recommend seeing this flick  as you ll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy  hilary and the movie that never got finished    years ago',1

'i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it  which was sometime last year  anyway i got to see today  and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after    mins or so  i thought that the movie was pretty good  but the thing i didn t like was how the killer was created  i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends  final cut  i almost died it  mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved  cut is     times better than ul final cut  the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes  the killer kicks mo f   ing ass i give cut a   out of',1

'there is so much to love in this darling little comedy  anyone who has ever built or bought a house  or even just been short of space will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr  blanding melvyn douglas with great comedic flare  both narrates and acts as the blandings  attorney and voice of reason as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife  but the best performance is grant s  he is the american everyman  especially relevant at the time of this film s release  when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war  the themes are universal lack of money  work strain  fear of infidelity yes  it does wrap up awfully neatly  but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war  and wanted a happy ending  it is still relevant today  and i must chalk up the poor reviews i see to a present preference for dumbed down  gross out comedies  the look of the film is slick  and there are some great bits of comedy is well  particularly toward the beginning while it may have lost some of it s social relevance  nearly sixty years after it s release  it is still a gem',1

'it isn t the worst film ever made  the actors aren t apalling and the script and director are not completely inept it isn t the best film ever made  the actors aren t excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant it falls somewhere in the middle  a fun somewhere  an enjoyable  well constructed somewhere no need to say  don t take it seriously  or  so bad its good  or  it wasn t scary   none of these comments are relevant cut has atmosphere  it s that atmosphere which is actually very unique  and the one really original aspect of the movie  which personally is what makes the film  for me',1

'this is not a bad movie  it follows the new conventions of modern horror  that is the movie within a movie  the well known actress running for her life in the first scene  this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose  and manage to do something new  and interesting with it  it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack so this might be an example of what the genre has become  cut hits all the marks  and is actually scary in some parts  i liked it i gave it an eight',1

'for a slasher flick this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre yes it is predictable resident nut job goes on killing spree people die yada yada yada however there are some good positives in this film first off i really liked the mask the nut job wore it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique although i haven t watched every single slasher film ever made also the genesis of the bad due is something i haven t seen before and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept as far as i know i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by mr sicko for most of the murders the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre but that a small concern the movie does not take itself seriously which is something most slashers suffer from oddly enough while watching the movie i was reminded of the early  friday the   th films which did take themselves seriously there are a few concerns about this movie in several scenes the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons by this i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot and also the way he walked of bigger concern however is a scene very close to the end where mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance actually a complete rip off of another famous horror titan and in the very last scenes we have our scumbag once again looking exactly like the  st horror icon i mentioned in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip off from another icon in the slasher genre  these scenes were weak and unoriginal obviously  by the way the movie is set in australia so if you re a sucker for a chick with an aussie accent like me you ll be in heaven if you not than it just might grate on you one other great thing about this movie beautiful kylie minogoue just don t get too attached to her there is one non aussie accent courtesy of molly ringwald overall there are more reasons to watch than not i enjoyed it and had some fun so i have to give  cut       which may seem too high to some people',1

'when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure type movies  the first thing i think of are    s slasher flicks  really bad slasher flicks  the formulaic type of film  where all a script needed was   parts blood and several parts nudity to get made flash forward to the late    s early    s  the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of      s  scream   like in the    s  these films were formulaic  masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as  hip  tongue in cheek parodies  of the original slasher flicks  of this recent blend of  hip parody  neo slasher flicks  the only one worth seeing is the low budget  direct to video  cut  like most of the other  new  slasher flicks   cut  relies on the production of a slasher flick  in this case a fictional      film  hot blooded   to make its commentary on the genre   hot blooded  never finished production  because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film s killer  scarman  a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark  pupil less eyes  now     years later  a group of film students  whose professor was involved in the production  have decided to go into the vaults  tap the original surviving actress  and finish the film  but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot   scarman  returns and someone dies  to quote the tagline  will they finish the film before it finishes them this all sounds really bad  and to a degree it is  really  is there such a thing as a good slasher flick    there is no character development  the  new  director is revealed to be the daughter of  hot blooded  s original director  whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled  this would ve been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot  yet it s never mentioned again  and  like in all other slasher flicks  there are just too many bodies to care about  the actors aren t great  even by direct to video standards  but most are having fun with their characters  and for those who aren t  it s inadvertent character acting  since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on  hot blooded    particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman   cut  s climax has no big  who dunnit  unmasking of the killer like in the  scream  films  it doesn t have the gimmick killings of the  urban legend  films  what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a  this way we can write a sequel if it sells well  ending  but that s par for the course by any sensible viewing standards  this is a horrible movie that should be avoided  but this  quality  is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre  and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo slasher flicks',1

'this is one of those little christmas movies for everyone  our scrooge is ben affleck  who decides money is not enough  so he rents the family who lives where he thought his family did  ok  this is a great little high school soap  pg     but the small sex references are comedy  so if your kid can t handle them  they can t live in the real world  either now  affleck is a hunk  and as usual walks through this fun  omg  remember when we did     ensemble piece as if he were at the end stages of some neuroinfectious disease  but that s ok  because even this old oracle keeps hoping that if ben s that well proportioned all over  well  there s hope for us ladies yet  luckily  the rest of the ensemble  catharine o hara  james gandolfini  christina applegate  udo kier and josh zuckerman  fill in and keep this shadow side ozzie and harriet christmas alternately hilarious  comfortable and warm this movie is the kind you can jump up and get popcorn  and when you get back  everyone wants to back it up to show you what you missed this is a happy film  after all  and it leaves you feeling good about life  love  family  christmas and chanel  there really is something for everyone',1

'cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams  it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations  both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget there are many great laughs  even if the story is somewhat thin  sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late     s hollywood comedy style  a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses  which must have sounded quite excessive to a      audience  as he makes his exit  he assures the client  grant  that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of         from the total   or at least          but certainly         hilarious',1

'come on people  this movie is better than    i can see this happening   wealthy people have done crazier things than this  and it was funny i watch a comedy to be entertained  escape from the pressures of the world for a short while  and not to have to take anything too seriously  this movie fully suits that purpose  i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles  i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring  likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home  it will remain on my list of  favorite     must watch for the holiday season   if you just want to have a fun    minutes  watch this one',1

'its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site  it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection  the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role  i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it  i rate it right up there with christmas vacation  the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well  the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act  the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the kranks  plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can t buy love with money',1

'i had some reservations about this movie  i figured it would be the usual bill of fare     a formula movie about christmas  being in the middle of a heat wave in late june  we decided to give it a shot anyway  maybe we would see some snow this movie turned out to be one laugh after another  ben affleck was believable in his character  but the real star of this one is james gandofini  he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great  dad  if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours  definitely check this one out',1

'at first i didn t think that ben affleck could really pull off a funny christmas movie   boy was i wrong  my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all  james gandolfini was funny   i really liked christina appelagate  and catherine o  hara was good too  the storyline is what really sold me   i mean   too put up with family   at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year   and probably don t get along with anyway   you really do need as much alcohol as you re system can stand to deal with christmas   so i thought that the premise was good there  buying the family with        dollars  was a little on the far fetched side   but it turned out to work pretty good for me   cause it was a riot all the way through  it shows the class struggle of the different families  it has lot s of funny moments  including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy  all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too',1

'what would you expect from a film titled  surviving christmas and presented as  festive fun   something like ghandi or english patient  there are lots of things i love about this film  it s funny  it is very well cast and it is superbly written  i came to the film as a kaplan elfort fan but was dubious when i read the plot  it sounded ridiculous  but the film doesn t come across like that because affleck  as drew latham  plays his part perfectly  one minute a child like adult  the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants  in fact we see latham grow up in this film  when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good  he sees that his own lot is not so bad this film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies i have seen  comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama  it either works or it doesn t and very few comedy writers get it correct every time i particularly loved the drama scene  where the family take to reading parts written by latham   the pleasure is in the reaction of tom valco  james gandolfini  and the comments of brian valco  josh zuckerman   it is the dilemma of the greedy tom valco who has to bite his tongue  wear silly hats or sing to the christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well the addition of daughter alicia  christina applegate  into the story brings a delightful romantic angle  and why not in a christmas film  of course its corny and contrived  he s rich and handsome  she s beautiful and single  and so inevitably her and afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face  great  one thing i would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but i can t really complain  i got what i wanted',1

'i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt  ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role  gandolfini gives his typical a performance  the entire cast is funny  the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome  i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted  i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy  can identify with loneliness during the holidays and or putting up with the relatives  the best part to this film  to me anyway  were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped  namely  the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree  go see it and have a good laugh',1

'this movie was made in       but it still rings true today  very  very funny  it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it  builds  from there  anyone who has ever built a house  will find this movie very endearing  great cast  cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film  this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the    s    clothing  architecture and family life  many references are made to the cost of things  and those comparisons to today s costs are pretty amazing  i can t imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely  i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it  a true classic',1

'this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in       so i was definitely going to watch the repeat  i really sympathised with the main character of the film  because  this is true  i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had  dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa  eb   this is a sad  sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder  jonny kennedy speaks like a kid  because of wasting vocal muscle  and never went through puberty  but he is    years old  most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition  and pealing off his bandages  jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour  he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin  he tells his story with the help of his mother  edna kennedy  his older brother and celebrity model  and jonny s supporter  nell mcandrew  it won the baftas for best editing and best new director  factual   and it was nominated for best sound  factual  and the flaherty documentary award  it was number    on the     greatest tv treats       a must see documentary',1

'i was greatly moved when i watched the movie how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing  so many people only care about what they want   and fuss about all the things they don t have   and they are such small things  like chothes money a new car   i ve seen people in tears because of a blemish  this movie brings everything back to the basics   love hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant  you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food  a roof over your head and your loved ones around you  you are truly blessed and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith strenght and humor with me  thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above',1

'this man is nothing short of amazing  you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events  and cry along with his family in the end  he was so passionate about his cause  not just for himself  but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain  i watch this video every time i am having a bad or  down  day  and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life  just like jonny did  even with his unbearable pain  my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner  as i visited england   times during his life  and would have been able to say i d met him  it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud  pain free  rest in peace  dear jonny  you deserve it',1

'the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created  i cried the whole way through  from start to end  watching the show you are immediately captured by a man s struggle to live without pain  to live a life we would take for granted  the first time i heard the title  i was almost scared to see the program  it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life  i truly felt for him  the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin  could you imagine doing that  even more so  even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity   debra jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration  he is the definition of a role model  what a true and undeniable hero he was',1

'was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions  so i turned to my twin sister and said   hey this looks like fun     truly i love documentaries   so we started watching it  at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man  but then it was explained that due to his condition  he never went through puberty  thus the high voice and smaller body  he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause  he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality    i cried  watched some more  laughed  got up to get another kleenex  then cried some more  once jonni kennedy s  time was up  he flew to heaven to be with the angels  he was more than ready  he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free  i highly recommend this  if you do not fall in love with this guy  you have no heart',1

'i couldn t hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary  it was heart breaking  disturbing  and inspiring all in one  i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives  or simply  something that will make you think  you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life  you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude  at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual  you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us  his life and struggles will make you cry  laugh  and find that life s a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time',1

'as with all of angelopoulos  films   the suspended step of the stork  implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer  a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work  dialogues are sparing  with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters  inner conflicts  doubts  or feelings  the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses  and instead forces them to explore and study the characters  identities for themselves  as a result  the acting is understated and implicit  as opposed to overt and explicit the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation  where the viewer is asked to become a participant  to participate as an actor  by probing his or her own psyche  as in a novel  where the drama rests entirely on the author s writing to provide a template where the reader s imagination and or past experience flourish  angelopoulos  drama rests within his images  his uses of the long shots  the long takes  the leisurely pacing  the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark  inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective  angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity  reverting to the non verbal language of gestures  gazes  sounds  and music  when he believes that words can only take us so far the music  by angelopoulos  long time collaborator  eleni karaindrou  provides more than just a discreet background  but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story  a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle  subdued colors  recorded in a drab winter light  angelopoulos presents us with an  other greece   one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures  with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas  drowned in an eternal sunshine  here  the skies are covered and gray  the air is cold and misty  and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled  dirty snow of the village streets  angelopoulos  genius through arvanitis  camera is on display throughout the film  the suspended step of the stork  is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century  it is deeply concerned with the meaning of  borders   and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations  in the  waiting room  facing the albanian border  the refugees  political or other  outcast by the rest of humanity  wait  they may be stuck against a political border  but unfortunately they still carry with them  and hang on  deeper ancestral borders  those of the languages  of the customs  and of the races  although angelopoulos  political views are well known  the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees  plights  in the process  angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical  cultural  political  and personal  borders  angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece  and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions  in this film  he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures  drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus  travel  alexander is a telemachus  in search of a story about an aging greek politician odysseus who disappeared  never to be heard of again  this political man  a brilliant orator  unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence  his wife  and his brilliant career  to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low  he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world  of course  the  politician  is not alexander s father  but the  politician  stands before alexander like a father figure odysseus  as with homer s telemachus  alexander grows as a person during his odyssey of course  it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer s odyssey in a contemporary context  angelopoulos draws on odysseus s travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film  in angelopoulos  ending   odysseus  is more like the dante s odysseus  he does not leave for ithaca but goes on   carrying a suitcase   and alexander telemachus is  suspended  between returning to his home and his career  or embarking on a voyage to  somewhere else   he states as much  in a voice over at the beginning of the film  paraphrasing few lines from dante s  inferno    and don t forget that the time for a voyage has come again  the wind blows your eyes far away  finally  although angelopoulos is not a religious person  there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow suited linesmen  who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications  and also the christ like figure of the  politician   in the final scene  these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography s influence in angelopoulos  work  they appear like  stylites   religious figures found in the orthodox tradition  solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars  in a form of asceticism the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni  angelopoulos does not give us any clues  and the wife s statement   it s not him   is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough  the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician  but that he could be the politician  but the film still ends on an optimistic note  whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river  and thus communications across the border are still not possible  and it remains impenetrable  we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river  the camera has crossed the border  and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary  on this account  angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow  some of the borders will eventually crumble',1

'one of cary grant s most enduring comedies is mr  blandings builds his dream house  although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today  still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of wham what made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii years  returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the gi bill of rights which included home loans  the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand  around the time the book by eric hodgins and the film were so popular congress passed and president truman signed the taft ellender  wagner housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties  like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester  their place wasn t quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen rooms  still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up  threatening to send cary to the cleaners  cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer counsel  usually too late  truth be told he s kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it myrna loy s role is simply an extension of nora charles  if you can imagine the charles s moving to the country and william powell having the headaches cary grant does  the film would still work just fine mr  blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal  and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over    years',1

'a most recommendable masterpiece  not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos  not to mention the acting of giants  mastroianni and moreau  and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis  gregory karr s performance may seem overshadowed by his  tough  partners  at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character  which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl  khrysikou  and the man  mastroianni   albeit hinted beforehand   hence the spoiler  get your expectations straight  it s an  art movie  in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention  not for spending free time  but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert  due to the overall photographic style  large screen viewing is recommended dialogues are used sparingly  but the film includes  in addition to the standard greek and english speaking  fragments spoken in albanian  kurdish and turkish  which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages',1

'i ve seen the thin man series    powell and loy are definitely great  but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthur s chemistry in this flick  jean arthur shines when she looks at powell  there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them  this film may not have the wit of the thin man series  but undeniably makes up for it in charm  while i watched it  i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off screen affair with arthur  my friends thought the same  this is one film where i wish i could step back in time  to schmooze and lock lips with powell   there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks  powell s character  lawrence bradford  is probably the closest thing to the  perfect man   okay  this is sounding way too gushy  but i can t help myself',1

'rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia  for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man  they succeeded to some degree a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles  bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role  so by this time he was pretty well set in the role  doctor bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as nick charles  but the basic blas nick is still there  one difference is that while nick charles married an heiress  doctor bradford works for a living as a physician  that helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film he s got two murders to solve  a jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason  the trainer suspects something afoot  but he s bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet  this is after he comes to bill powell for help myrna loy was a more steadying influence on bill powell than jean arthur was  arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than loy did  but it works here and she and powell have good chemistry the ever dependable james gleason is the police inspector in the sam levene nat pendleton role  all they needed here was asta and possibly eric blore as powell s butler was essaying that part if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of bradford films',1

'i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region   dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it  a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan the story is pretty straight forward  and has been mentioned already so i won t go into it again  needless to say it s the fight scenes that many buy the movie for  and they do not disappoint  only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed  bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time  all kicks and punches come with the all important  type writer  clicks and air  whooshes   which is a cool effect though quite amusing i give this movie a b   good but not great  in a way i feel it could have been that bit better  golden swallow  by the same director a decade earlier  had as good a story and better action',1

'the five deadly venoms is easily the most memorable k f  flick from the shaw brothers  stable  exc  maybe master killer   it has the artists who came to be known as simply  the venoms   some of the best fight choreography ever  and  surprisingly for a kung fu movie  a great plot  one of my all time favorites',1

'five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas  but it features some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in hong kong film history  director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece  this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms  meng lo plays yet another bad ass  he would go on to be in super ninjas  kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled  any chop socky fan can apperciate this  but i still think it ain t as good as super ninjas  also made by chang cheh   but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best',1

'i loved this film  i first saw it when i was      which was only four years ago  and i enjoyed it so much  i brought my own copy the next day  the comedy is well played by all involved  i always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where mr  tsanders explains why he found water at   ft in one area and     feet in another area  also look for jason robards father who plays mr  retch  talent ran in that family',1

'i recall seeing this movie as a kid  i don t recall where i saw it  i must have been around    years old  i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again  it came on the kung fu channel once  but i missed it  i was really bummed  it is the best special effects kung fu movie that i ve seen to date  i highly recommend it  and now that i ve discovered where to get it  i can enjoy it once more and for years to come  i also have to check out this return of the venom movie of which some have spoken so highly',1

'after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin  i bought it on dvd  hence the  spin  pun   i m a dork   the beginning was everything i hoped for  a perfect set up  along with some quotes that i ve heard on various wu tang albums  to what should have been a good movie  but the plot i heard was so great  was so predictable  every time i saw a character  except for the lizard  i guessed which venom he was  plus  the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie  ok  so the plot wasn t very good but at least there was some good kung fu right  wrong  the fights were very short and few and far between  granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer  i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened  i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened  i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than   total minutes but it never happened  in short  not much happens  the fighting is all pretty routine  don t be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot  it does not mean it s a good one',1

'when i was very young on a local tv station they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on saturdays i saw lots of kung fu movies on weekends i remember lots of them i saw great flicks like crippled masters blind fist of bruce kung fu zombie shaolin drunken monk rage of the master tattoe dragon and   five deadly venoms i remember the day clearly me and my dad had just gotten lunch at burger king we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday we ran in the house and jumped onto the couch turned on the set and flicked it onto    the usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words kung fu saturday over it then under that was the title of the film it said five deadly venoms then the movie began i bit into my burger amused with the pre credit sequence i loved this movie the minute it came on my favorite character was the toad venom the plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn t what lured me   it was the fighting the fights were so   amazing i moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the   hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended',1

'this movie is really good  the plot  which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess  what will happen next  such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle  fighting scenes are very good  there s a lot of different combat styles  although one of styles was a bit unreal for me  but it s only my opinion  to watch and it s fascinating show  the only thing which may be irritating is actors look  a bit too effeminate  at least for me   hong kong was always good at kung fu movies especially in the    s and    s  so  five venoms   or other its versions  is great choice',1

'i saw this kung fu movie when i was a kid  and i thought it was so cool  now i am    years old  and my friend has it on dvd   we got a case of brew  and watched this classic  it lost none of it s original kung fu coolness  if you are a fan of kung fu karate movies  this is a must see    the dvd is available  i believe this movie is also called  pick your poison  watch it soon',1

'i really like this movie  i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it  i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie the story is very interesting  it introduces us to   characters  each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly  each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other  the dying master sends the  th venom  his last student  to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed how will the last pupil find the other venoms  how will he know which of them is bad  the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination  it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other if you want to see if you like kung fu movies  this is a good movie to start with  it doesn t get any better than this',1

'if you love kung fu films and you haven t seen this movie  you are cheating yourself  this movie is one of the only kung fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film  normally  it takes a die hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films  but this one has it all  the story is well told  and complete  the fight scenes are great  and tend to end before you re completely bored with them  unlike crouching tiger   throw in a little mystery and torture and you ve got yourself one heck of a movie  see this one at all costs  heck  my wife even enjoyed it wu du it   out of',1

'this is one of my favourite kung fu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late    s  the plot is interesting and twisty  the characters are cool each with their own style   toad  snake  lizard etc  the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh   venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung fu styles on display from the various characters  i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang cheh s films are the same  most of his films usually focus on the    tigers and shaolin vs manchu conflicts  this film is breath of fresh air in comparison',1

'one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema  or  indeed  most anything done outside these holier than thou united states  are the permutations that crop up  in post world war two japanese manga  comics   for instance  are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects  many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion  the same thing happens in genre film making  as well  though  again  i m referring to movies made outside the u     where we re just too  sophisticated  in our close mindedness to appreciate anything that isn t about or by us   would an american company  for instance  back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler  el santo  or a werewolf  paul naschy  or a real life martial artist  bruce lee      as for television  forget it  while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine  i ve always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was  how to put it kindly  a bit lacking  to this very day  there hasn t been a pay per view channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia   there are lots of soft core porn masquerading as entertainment shows  but the so called action channel  for instance  has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries   before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc  there was  of all things  at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery  the   deadly venoms  in its own right as fascinating as any other genre based whodunit  western  cop show  etc    this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work  it s now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent  thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve  if you re a martial arts movie fan  rejoice  one of the greatest movie genres of all time  specifically  the martial arts movies of the     s and early     s  are getting a long overdue second life  and greatly appreciated second look  on dvd',1

'by the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over  as films were moving in a different direction  comedically and otherwise  with television looming on the horizon  hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time  where  one wonders  would movies have gone had television not come along  or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years  mr  blandings builds his dream house offers one particular way comedy might have developed ad man jim blandings  along with his wife and two daughters  are living in a nice but way too cramped new york city apartment  as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs  so he buys some property in connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications  well  almost  had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind  then again he might not have  you decide  on this frail premise a wonderful film results  full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one s own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one  nothing comes easy in this life  as mr  blandings learns  but one needn t be miserable just because things don t always go one s way  there is  after all  the long run  but  blandings asks himself every few minutes  how long is long this movie is a delight  it is not  i suppose  a masterpiece in the capra mccarey tradition  but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures  and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically  there is real warmth in the picture  and a good deal of  w c   fieldsian hard edged reality obtruding periodically  but not so much as to leave a bad taste  the people in the film are all very smart and affluent  but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class lead players cary grant and myrna loy plays mr  and mrs  blandings to perfection  while melvyn douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend  who often has to bring up unpleasant topics  such as how the real world works  there is  too  a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia  which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years  as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place  these people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural connecticut  in a few short years things would change  as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear  destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns  which soon would be connected by highways  littered with bottles and cans  their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city',1

'in the world of old school kung fu movies  where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen  it took a lot for a film to stand out    and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years  what is arguably chang cheh s finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry  from the themes of loyalty  brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo  who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang  during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late      s  to more modern movies like a man called hero  which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film  the influence has also carried into other areas as well  from music such as the wu tang clan  tv commercials for sprite and video games such as  mortal kombat   so what makes this movie so special  the plot    on the surface    is pretty simple  it deals with members of a rogue group known as the  poison clan  who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu  all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities  denoted by their animal styles  or  venoms   the lizard can climb walls  the scorpion has a deadly strike  etc    the twist is that since the clan always wears masks  not all of them known who the others are  thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller  we re not talking the usual suspects here  but it s far above many other kung fu movies of the time  supposedly  golden harvest was not too happy with chang s script    like most of his movies  they felt it was too dark and violent    and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it  thankfully  chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script  which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time  if not ever  completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves  chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast    not only did he gain talented martial artists  whose moves  competed without the aid of wires or other special effects  put most modern martial artists to shame  but great actors as well  the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies  getting back to matters at hand  in most old school movies  the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts  but here the actors actually create characters  it seems that everyone has a favorite venom  mine is philip kwok    best known to many as mad dog from hard boiled    as lizard  and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre  even if you re normally not a fan of old school movies  you need to check the five deadly venoms out  if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from',1

'be careful with this one  once you get yer mitts on it  it ll change the way you look at kung fu flicks  you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung fu films now  you will be wanting character depth and development  you will be craving mystery and unpredictability  you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops  sadly  you won t find all of these aspects together in one kung fu movie  except for five deadly venoms easily the best kung fu movie of all time  venoms blends a rich plot  full of twists and turns  with colourful  and developed  characters  along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the   s  the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which  and who specializes in what venom  one is the centipede  two is the snake  three is the scorpion  four is the lizard  and five is the toad  each character has different traits  characteristics  strengths  and weaknesses  therein lies the hook  we learn along with the student character  finding out who these different men turn out to be  we are in his shoes  so to speak   and we have to pick who we trust  and who we don t  just like he does  we learn along with him not only is the plot  the characters  and the camerawork great  it s also fun to watch  which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it s kind  it s worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that s going on  venoms is a lesson on what kung fu can really do   just don t expect many other kung fu films to live up to it s gauntlet',1

'after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly    years  i must say it did not lose any of its mysticism  nor any of its eye popping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth  the story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his  unfinished  pupil out to find the   past members of his poison clan  so they do not seek out a fortune which the master s friend keeps hidden  afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training  he instructs him to befriend one of the five  venoms  so as to defeat the other four i can t say enough about the choreography or the camera work  a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made  a classic',1

'most   s  and   s  kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies  usually there are a few well planned fight sequences  but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes    like porno films  really but this one does several things well  most overtly  there is the direction and choreography  which confines each combatant to a  style     it s really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater  but the effect works second  there is the language of the camera  which uses some impressive techniques even by today s measure   changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion  and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future least overt  but most powerful and unexpected  is the construction  the winner of this contest is determined by who  unfolds  the story  the master  the writer  sets up a game where the lead character doesn t know who he s seeking  which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in  one by one  he figures out who is who  at the same rate we find out who is who  it all follows a tragedy noir arc  the ending tends toward irony  a la  the sting   much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre the  five venoms  idea is the template for tarantino s  deadly viper assassins  from the  kill bill  volumes',1

'for all the hoopla  respect and recognition this film gets from kung fu historians  it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas  action and fight scenes  but i must say that the plot is probably the best and most original i ve ever seen in a martial arts film  five deadly venoms without a doubt is a must see  not only that  a movie you can watch again and again  but i also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better  it somehow leaves you wanting something  you want more  the producer chang cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn t follow through with giving us more of the action we want  the fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer  centipede snake scorpion lizard toad  and they are shown  but battles are noticeably short  the toad and snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much  much more  in fact the toad is killed off by the middle of the movie  interestingly enough with this movie  the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot  this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome  this movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe  sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel  to start off the movie and to introduce the poison clan producer chang cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon  the ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more  still though this movie is one of shaw brothers best and is quite enjoyable  my overall impression of the movie would conclude with this  the styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail  sad thing is   the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn t expand on it  i am left wondering what could have been with this movie  still one of the best though    out of    on the scale',1

'seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately  this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic  i happened to see the dubbed version but i m on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue  still  the dubbing didn t get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour   poison clan rocks the world    the story telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue  suspense  and inter personal relationships  you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the   venoms are revealed and an expert pace the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed  it s like watching real animals fight each other  but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms  such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film s genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution     of course  if you just want to see people pummel each other  along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture  be my guest',1

'the five deadly venoms is a great kung fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery  there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung fu flick  great choreography  awful dubbing  different  styles  of fighting  and a wide range of greatly exaggerated  often cheesey human emotions  however the plot certainly is better than average  it s interesting and holds your attention throughout the non fight scenes  occasionally it s even able to fire up the audience  such as when x character receives horrible injustice another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie s morals and themes  just about everyone gets what s coming to them  the cowardly  greedy  and corrupt lose out  the bad guys  consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing  the good guys use teamwork  planning  and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top poison clan rocks',1

'i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv the one scene that always stands out  for me that is  is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman  where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says  did you get that  that s yellow  blue  green and white',1

'this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever  and may be one of the best movies ever    it s got a great plot that functions like a puzzle  with lots of intrigue and suspense  this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions  with people hiding their identities and their natures  the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters  they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality s and desires the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting  it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy  there are   members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal  the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film    when this happens  the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel  these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death  the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death  this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective  we actually care when people are killed in this film  this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed  some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching  when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain at the same time  this is also a fun movie  it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film  there is bad dubbing  the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat  some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic    all this just adds to the greatness of the film and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries  if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic  everything goes by so fast  because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre  that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is  the lighting and composition are spectacular at times  the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing    in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example  imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed  chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it s confines  he doesn t rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film  but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work  he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level  it s art  it s trash  it s emotionally moving  and it s fun  it has a true sense of morality  but doesn t allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action  i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not',1

'the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarah s own stand up  it s so over the top with prejudice that you can t possibly take it to heart  the fact is  though  that while most all people will  get it   it doesn t mean they will all appreciate it  it s a very polarizing and one dimensional show  so if you don t like it after    minutes  you may as well give up there  if you do like it after    minutes  stay tuned  because every episode thus far has been as good as the last like all shows  though  it is not perfect  personally i love the program  but there are some huge faults with it  racist songs are funny  but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize  a problem that i had with  jesus is magic  as well  it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesn t need to exist  not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good  the music  well  isn t another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python  upright citizens brigade  etc   it is nothing like those shows  i can watch monty python all day  but  as much as i like this show  i can t watch more than the half hour limit at a time  it gets flat very fast  the repeat value for this show is low too  the second time around an episode is fairly funny  and by the third time  in my opinion  it s boring still  that first time around is very  very funny  give it a shot',1

'following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use  the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah s erratic persona which  beyond general insensitivity  has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on  making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene  sarah s ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed  every time she speaks it s like a self contained   second skit  she overemotes a lot  demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify  but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied  this may be the most creative  original and experimental tv program ever',1

'first and foremost i would like to say that i m a huge sarah silverman fan  and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me  everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form  maybe not directly funny  but the situation and the delivery are what counts if you liked jesus is magic then i don t see how you wouldn t like this  it has that same flow and that same rhythm  true it s only for the true fans  but if you are you ll be pleased again only for the true fans  there s no way around that  if you re not used to her style then you wouldn t get why this is funny  however  it is  and i hope you think so too',1

'this is one of the few comedies i can watch again and again and still laugh out loud  in other places  i have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious  politically correct prigs  there is neither here  unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid the lines are hilarious  and all the leads have never been better  melvin douglas is especially brilliant if you ve ever thought of or tried to build a new house  you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process  no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel  you are not alone',1

'when i first saw this show  i thought it looked interesting  i watched it  saw how it revolved around sarah  like the character sees the world   revolving around her  i got it  but wasn t laughing very much onstage and in her show  she s racist  crude  insensitive and hugely self centered  i didn t get her at first  and took it all at face value  then i got to see her movie  jesus is magic  i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me  explaining to me just what  language  she s speaking  she s like marilyn manson  working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images  but you eventually realise it isn t an assault  it s a statement  and once you understand that  you find you re glad someone s finally giving it to you straight i don t mean to suggest only smart people will understand  or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy  while i like a lot of  smart  shows  i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm  i get the impression that it s good  but i just don t get it  many people will never get the sarah silverman program  but i m glad i eventually came around the creators of this show do work hard  every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot  but with songs  or dream sequences  production numbers  these people aren t putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers  they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together  if i was to predict the future of this show  i d say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks   geeks  it will get canceled before it s time and live on in fans  hearts and on dvd  but take heart  ssp creators  your audience is out there  and we ll be watching for as long as they let you make the show',1

'big s isn t playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like  say mencia or chapelle  though i like them both   she states the obvious in subtle  near subliminal remarks  her show won t change the world  nor is it meant to  but  along with the hilarious brian posehn and paget brewster s ex boyfriend jay johnston of  mr  show  fame  this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction  my side s were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode  look  i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend  jimmy kimmel  she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run  with it  the best kind of comedy around  spoofing anything and anyone  like  mary poppins  in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense  this one is highly recommended  but only for those who still have a funny bone  and didn t lose it in their most recent lippo suction treatment or boob job',1

'sarah silverman is a dangerous bitch  she s beautiful  sexy  funny and talent  dark and demonic  i read the other  comment  on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don t get it  nothing that appears on t v  is an accident  too much money  time and work is put into the production of a t v  show for there to be mistakes  this show is stupid because sarah wanted it to be stupid  this show is juvenile because sarah wanted it to be juvenile  i thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre  it s a lot like pee wee s playhouse for maladjusted  slacker twenty something glue sniffing  future pornstars of america from the valley  the cast is awesome  the scenarios and action is well paced  i hope this show succeeds since comedy central didn t let david spade keep his show  who plays sarah s sister  she not in the cast listing on the show s home page  i would love to see her stand up  does anyone know about her up coming show dates or dvds that may be floating around out there',1

'i think this show is screamingly funny  it s not for every taste  and i m not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that don t get it  i m sure they re wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength  but if you like it  you really like it  sarah plays a self infatuated loser named  sarah silverman  who often finds her self in homerian predicaments  that s  homerian  as in  homerian simpsonian   i remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early    s  i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything she s done this show is choke on your food and wet your pants funny  therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers  check it out',1

'sarah silverman is like a totally manic zooey deschanel and i think i m in love already  yeah  if you loved jesus is magic  you ll love this  if you didn t  what the heck is wrong with you  kudos to the comedy channel for shoving this in my face  my life finally has meaning  and  your car smells like farts  is my kind of humor  i m a happy guy  the first episode had me laughing hysterically and i m hungrily looking forward to next week  this is like grease meets south park  completely outrageous  sarah silverman is someone i could watch reading the phone book  her delivery is precise and oh so funny  she never skips a beat  come to think of it  it s not so much her choice of material  which is some really good stuff by the way  as it is the way she chooses to deliver it  thank you  sarah silverman  thank you  comedy channel',1

'for those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity  you are in fact the mindless one  while the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems  racial barriers  clich s stereotypes etc  you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it what i also love is that not everything is a punchline  for those expecting a formulated joke like friends  i love friends fyi   you won t find it here  instead sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic  we don t walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said  which is in most comedies  instead the sarah silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense so don t take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that',1

'this show probably won t appeal to everyone  sarah does what she wants  she doesn t ask for permission and she doesn t apologize  this is a sitcom with zombies  robot dinosaurs  flying cars  and a team of wallet stealing male cheerleaders  the star of the show is not a hero  she is a spoiled  bigoted pervert  if you can t appreciate the offbeat humor it offers  the show probably isn t for you  everyone should at least give this show a chance  it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman  brian posehn  the comedians of comedy   jay johnston  mr  show   steve agee  bobcat goldthwait s  stay   and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon  heat vision   jack  monster house   it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community  channel    com   if you re into this show  keep an eye out for  the department of acceptable media  on vh  this march  it ll be drawing from the same talent pool  watch sarah silverman s show  this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment',1

'this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldn t stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight  despite the fact that i ve seen all the episodes previously   i ve always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience  i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time    i can t say that about many tv shows    can you  this show is finally something new and interesting and  most importantly  funny  this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out  you owe it to yourself to watch this show    i predict a long run for this series    and just to be clear  the people who are offended by this show just don t get it    perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it    they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don t understand  anyone who uses the word  bigot  in reference to silverman  or who claims that she only aims to  shock     is way off the mark    she s exactly the opposite  just google her and you ll quickly see that she s a huge proponent of civil rights  etc  if you don t know that she s ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints  you don t get it  and if you don t get it  do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity',1

'all i can say is  if you don t fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie  then you re not human  even after watching it for the first time  i was hooked  it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe  as i m sure other fans will attest to  after watching it  you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us  at least we have grey gardens to remember them  i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with  although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy  she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do  what a rare treat to have know such people  i only wish i had',1

'great acting  great movie  if you are thinking of building see this movie first  the dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same  the humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt',1

'i really can t remember who recommended this  but they said it was one of their favorite films  it is certainly a strange one   like rubbernecking at a highway accident someone said that truth is stranger than fiction  and the truth here is something to see  i really can t understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year  how can you improve on this  the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton s  in the process they become recluses and what is best described as  crazy cat ladies   they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie  this film was done after that rescue  all during  you couldn t help but think   how bad was it before   it s a look at high society from the darker side  and it is utterly fascinating',1

'one of the best love stories i have ever seen  it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion  but lovely nonetheless    big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly  and are infinitely quotable   it s a goddamned beautiful day  now will you just shut up   the opening explanation of little edie s costume only promises that the movie will live on forever  and so will big edie  the world famous singer  and little edie   the world famous dancer',1

'it s interesting how the train of research can flow  i started out looking at an article about cristo s  the gates  in central park  the article stated that the maysles had been cristo s filmographers for years  hmmm    then i got to looking at their body of work  i believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming cristo and jean claude in their stages of creation  grey gardens sounded very interesting  video station  in boulder co  is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock  dvd and vhs  edith and edie are women living in the past  and oh what a glorious past it was  edith had been well off  born a bouvier  married well  had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties  her daughter edie had been a dbutante  a fashion model and had many beaus  she never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate  she seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind  worrying too much about things  it is only a shadow of the world they live in though  because jackie o  came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted  it is a    room mansion that is worn down and worn out  but  in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls  if you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess  the outfits edie comes up with a very clever and creative  the viewer gets the impression that edith likes to go nude  but she doesn t in the movie  edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings  tea for two   edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at     it was a good movie  though not for everyone  when the cat is urinating behind edith s portait she states    at least someone is doing what they want',1

'little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for  even though their house was filthy  this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness  on the message board a poster wrote that  little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old   this reminded me of when in the dramatized      version  big edie says to little edie   if you re stuck  it s only with yourself   these women had everything  beauty  talent  intelligence  firm belief in their opinions and actions  perhaps if little edie wasn t so hard on herself the first time things didn t work out  losing her hair  her job  and the love of her life  she would have made it  this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness  her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead  the world will never know what have happened if she didn t listen to her mom s plea   come home  edie  let me take care of you  yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant  heartbreaking  and lovable  even in their extremely filthy home  these women were extraordinary  and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness  when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns  dwelling about what could have been  or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl  one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that  everything will be okay  great documentary',1

'grey gardens is a world unto itself  edith and little edie live in near total isolation  eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their  apparently  shared bedroom  cats loll about while mother edith insults her daughter s elocution  this is a tennessee williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights  as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is      real the situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her    ish daughter lived for a decade  other than that they were poor and clean   they would bicker all day  grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men  work  and self expression this film is a must see for anyone writing a mother daughter relationship of this kind  it is sad and voyeuristic  but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly  it is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context  remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion',1

'i first saw this movie in my plays   playwrights course at tulane  i was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was  it is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude  the family is fascinating and i thought it really showed little edie at her core    as a side note my professor even told me that throughout the filming  little edie became infatuated with one of the camera men    the beauty  i find  comes from the naturalness of the family s dysfunction  it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for little edie s rehabilitation to society  in all  the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it s portrayal of surprising beauty  two thumbs way up',1

'i knew about but had never seen grey gardens  before i saw the broadway musical of the same name  friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie  the musical would not make sense  it did  but it also prompted me to rent the movie  at first  i thought it was a train wreck  full of strange  shrieking characters  and it was exceedingly hard to watch  but being able to stop it  digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self consciousness is worth witnessing  both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age  they have a relationship that will chill any woman  and undoubtedly some men  and make you re  examine your own dealings with your mother  in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace  it s fascinating to see the mayleses  work from three decades ago  and realize what an impact the film must have had i echo what other posters have said  how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family  but beyond that  how could two people living in the     s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion  or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped  i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track  which gave me additional insight into the film',1

'i first saw this film in      in the midday movie spot  after many subsequent viewings  and purchase of the video  it still makes me laugh out loud yes  it s a relic of another age   a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class america   but well executed is well executed  but it s also a document of its age   a celebration of post war optimism  the baby boom and the nascent consumer age  this film is no  guilty  pleasure three wonderful sophisticated leads actors   urbane melvyn douglas  bemused cary grant  daffily determined myrna loy   complement each other and a memorable team of characters my favourite scenes    it means we gotta blast  and  miss stellwaggen  and  this little piggy  love it',1

'grey gardens is shocking  amusing  sad and mesmerizing  i watched in amazement as ediths jr  and sr  bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past  their existence in a dilapidated mansion   which they had not left for more than fifteen years  is both a comedy and a tragedy  this is a film you will not soon forget',1

'i only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title  it now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films  it is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully  it has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world  i fell in love with this film and with the characters in it  it is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric beales  a true aristocratic family  it has a tangible atmosphere and i found myself wishing i could be there away from it all  cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table  it has an air of sadness that permeates throughout  a fall from greatness for this once esteemed family  the money had gone but their airs and graces remained  as well as their beauty  it drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished i found myself wondering about their fate  wondering that if i took a walk along east hampton beach i might still hear old edie s voice in the night and see the silhouette of little edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper  unforgettable',1

'excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies  they couldn t live together  nor apart  babbling constantly  sometimes at the same time  they hashed and re hashed the past  going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda  i found myself laughing at times  but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were  see this one',1

'why should you watch this  there are certainly no reasons why you shouldn t watch it  superbly and amusingly directed by albert and david maysles  grey gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of east hampton  but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two edith bouvier beales  the aunt and cousin of jacqueline kennedy onassis  their life was certainly an amusing one  edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas  edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats  one was named ted z  kennedy  the film is interesting because it is both funny and sad   edith died shortly after the film was released  in february       aged    after experiencing some of the fame that she and edie received after the film  she danced and sang in a nightclub edie beale jr was born in      and is still living in miami beach this film is both engaging and spellbounding',1

'this is why i so love this website   i saw this film in the      s on british television  over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life  with barely a few key words to remember it by  i traced the film here  and much information  including the fact it s about to become an off broadway musical  interestingly  unlike the previous comment maker  i do not remember finding this film sad  or exploitative  on the contrary  the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength  honour and dignity  ironic you may think  considering the squalor of their lives  maybe it s because i live in britain  where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money  where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding  i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit  deep and profound humour  whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect  in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a  cult   over the years  as it faded in my mind  it shone the brightest  above all others as a one off brilliant   outstanding televisual experience  it was such a deeply private expose  it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical  but perhaps somewhere  the daughter will be amused by such an outcome  it is she who will have the last laugh maybe   they made a musical out of her before you jackie o',1

'i took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night  having no idea of the film s cult  influence  or that it is currently being staged as a musical     most of the comments here are on target  it s moving  funny  sad  and yes  a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers  the expanded chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared  you can hear it in old films of jackie o too  people just don t talk like that anymore  i think as a documentary  it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute  old edie at least still seems aware of what s going on to a certain degree  couldn t she see the once spectacular home disintegrating yet the film s subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now  a real life tennesse williams one act  well worth your time',1

'several years ago when i first watched  grey gardens  i remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp  years later i still laugh out loud when i watch it  but after many viewings i ve come to see the beauty in the strange  twisted relationship between the inseparable  big  edith bouvier beale and her daughter  little  edith bouvier beale mother and daughter living together in their decaying    room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term  shabby chic   with innumerable cats  raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece of jackie o  allowed filmmakers albert and david maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day  the result is a hilarious  beautiful  sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love  and their lives an example of drive  determination and free will  this movie has more to recommend it than i can put down into words  it is a rare experience that you must see for yourself',1

'this documentary follows the lives of big and little edie beale  a mother and daughter  who lived as recluses in their family mansion in east hampton  ny from the mid   s through the late   s  by the time the filmmakers find them  the mansion is falling apart  and the women  one    and the other     share a squalid room  the older edie beale is the aunt of jackie kennedy onassis and the younger is her first cousin  the women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition  but jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there at times this movie can seem exploitative  as neither woman seems in the best of mental health  but at other times  the movie is hard to look away from   little  edie blames her mother for her current state  and her mother fires back that edie was never going to be the success she thought she was   little  edie often seems trapped in the past  focused on choices she made decades ago  and loves showing off pictures from her youth  where she clearly was a beautiful debutante  her mother seems more resigned to her fate  to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions  there are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead  from the pictures that show a happy family  to the grand portrait of the older edie next to her bed  from what we see of the house  most of the rooms in it are empty  the walls are cracking and falling apart  and  little  edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on  and of course there are numerous cats running around at its heart  this documentary is incredibly sad  while neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life  the squalor they live in is utterly awful  it s not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house  and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family however  as a documentary  the film is a wonder to behold  and is highly recommended',1

'i stopped short of giving  mr  blandings builds his dream house        due to an aspect that makes us in the   st century cringe a little bit  the fact that a black person is the faithful servant  somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit   but other than that  the movie s a hoot  portraying middle class new york couple jim  cary grant  and muriel blandings  myrna loy  trying to build a house in connecticut  this flick has something for everyone grant is his usual flippant self  while loy does quite well as merely a wife  but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as jim s and muriel s lawyer bill cole  who seems to have more plans than he s making clear  as for the house itself   throughout most of the movie  you ll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there  the builders  contractors  and others also provide their fair share of laughs all in all  a comedy classic  also starring louise beavers  reginald denny  sharyn moffett  connie marshall and jason robards sr',1

'hey now  yours truly  theatrex  found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market  in almost new condition  and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a  cult hit  so of course it came home with me what a strange film  the aunt and cousin of former first lady jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis live in this decaying    room house out on long island  suffolk co   and share the house with raccoons  cats  fleas  eyow   and who knows what else  suffolk co  was all over them at one point for living in filth and old jackie herself came by to set things right  anyway  this is one strange pair  big edie and little edie   edie  the daughter  always wears something over her head and dances  sings  and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense  big edie  the mother  age     apparently likes to run around naked  and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully     done to the point where we re mercifully spared from that  these women talk and talk and talk  mostly about the past  and it doesn t make a whole lot of sense  except to them  they live in absolute filth  cats doing their business wherever   look  that cat s going to the bathroom behind my portrait     and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations  if i close my eyes and listen to big edie s voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt  who was from that area of the country and had that lawn guyland accent  one scene has little edie putting on flea repellent  lovely  you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested  the box refers to these two women as  eccentric   and i d have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for  wacked out of their gourds   but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them  this is equal parts creepy  sad  and disgusting  but i couldn t stop watching once i started  this is not my  normal  type of flick but i found it to be somewhat fascinating  it won t be for everybody though  guaranteed',1

'grey gardens        is the maysles  brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassis eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down    room mansion on east hampton  long island  big edie  bouvier beale    witty and dry and her daughter   little edie  beale     emotionally about     a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic  they amuse themselves by bickering all day  listening to the radio or singing to each other they dont even own a television  their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special  although obviously  dysfunctional people one of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today',1

'one question that must be asked immediately is  would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of jacqueline lee bouvier kennedy onassis the answer is  probably not but  thankfully  they are  or were  the cousin and aunt of jackie this documentary by the maysles brothers on the existence  one could hardly call it a life  of edith b  beale  jr   and her daughter edith bouvier beale  edie   has the same appeal of a train wreck    you don t want to look but you have to big edith and little edie live in a once magnificent mansion in east hampton  new york  that is slowly decaying around them  the once beautiful gardens are now a jungle magnificent oil painting lean against the wall  with cat feces on the floor behind them  and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others clothing is seems to be optional  edie s favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head as edith says  edie is still beautiful at      and indeed she is  there are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there there is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension their eating habits are  to be polite  strange  ice cream spread on crackers  a dinner party for edith s birthday of wonder bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils time is irrelevant in their world  as edie says  i don t have any clocks  their relationships with men are oh so strange edie feels like edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness  she says  if you can t get a man to propose to you  you might as well be dead   to which edith replies  i ll take a dog any day  it is obvious that edith doesn t see her role in edie s lack of male companionship  early in the film she states  france fell but edie didn t sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said  both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other there is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film  edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with wonder bread and cat food  the cats  and there are many of them  are everywhere at one point edie declares  the hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility   but they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves this is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort',1

'i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this   many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal   documentary of not  this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes  i kept focusing on how these women  who are clinically way beyond eccentric  reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways  and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue blood universe  perhaps some abuse  or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its  own  this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation  without going completely over the edge   as the edies do their thing  i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble strewn bedroom  cats urinating on the bed  racoons emerging from holes in the walls  and the final scene seemed incredibly sad   like a child s birthday party gone seriously wrong  very definitely worth seeing and seeking out   you ll never forget it  but very disturbing',1

'we stumbled upon the documentary  grey gardens  last sunday and got  sucked in  without warning  everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach  eating ice cream and corn on the cob  which was cooked on the bedside table   and the cat urinating on edith s bed and her unbelievable words   i thrive on it  the smell    we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in  spellbinding  a must see',1

'trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn t yet seen  renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse  my son is so jaded with current  b  science fiction that he hasn t bothered seeing this yet it must be noted i didn t see anything about cypher when it was released in australia  it must have been very quiet or i just missed it well this was a really pleasant surprise  this is also no b movie  it s not a  blockbuster  of the epic variety and doesn t try to be   more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it s plot to be fully savoured the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used   my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view  but they get it right at it s  nd appearance    that aside everything else is top notch  in any case the affects are secondary i won t give anything away about the plot  the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct  though with very different content  just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke  the actor was born in cambridge england  and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect  it s a tad off key  see the final twist of the plot and you ll see why that is such a brilliant choice  and lucy liu is also just right with her  will she kiss me   will she shoot me  edge i rarely watch movies several times within days   this is one of them',1

'cypher  is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future  while thematically not complex  this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty  ruthlessness  and corporate conspiracy  to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man  morgan sullivan  jeremy northam   who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative  after an initial briefing with digicorp s security chief  sullivan is then given a new identity  jack thursby  and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies  upon successfully completing his first assignment  sullivan thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered  however  on one of his  business trips  he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster   liu  whom he had met on his previous assignment  and from there things go extremely topsy turvy  the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp s espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp s main competitors  thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies   spoilers end here  what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes  vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic household settings  while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover up  i was also very impressed with jeremy northam  not too often have i seen him in the lead role  and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant  personally  i think he s one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn t been given more challenging roles  lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak and dagger tone  additionally  the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job  however  my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated  for example  i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second  wife   overall  this is a cleverly developed cloak and dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted  with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work  this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future  i m surprised that i had never watched this  hidden gem  before  this is a brilliant  not too overly complicated spy thriller  and therefore i m giving it a   out of',1

'modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake   the money pit   older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia  cary grant  myrna loy  and melvyn douglas were all  superstars  in an easier  less complicated era  or was it  time  of course  has a way of modifying perspectives  and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary  there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older  seemingly less provocative films  in  mr  blandings builds his dream house   there may  therefore  be more than what audiences were looking for in       there is political commentary  however subtle  finding a house in the late   s was a truly exasperating experience  only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like  politics in the movie  the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school  which in real life would get teachers accused of communism   in real life  too  myrna loy was a housing activist  a democrat  and a feminist  melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand  he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas  whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism  and which ruined her   jason robards  sr   has a small role in the film  but his political activism was no less noticeable  more importantly  his son  jason robards  jr   would be for many years a very active liberal democrat  almost the odd fellow out was cary grant  whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping  but this was       communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner  it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films  and then not so subtly',1

'cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it s not the run of the mill sci fi flick  the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what s going on  the close up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive  the sci fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie  the technology used in the movie isn t overly impressive  however  the director makes good use of the props the character development is intentionally shallow  the main character  jeremy northam  decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage  it s up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it s the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end',1

'damn  i ve seen this movie for at least   times now and i still don t get bored watching it the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind blowing to me the cgis are quite bad imho  but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just    just a genius perfect combination for such a movie  the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable  the plot is so good however although  the movie had little flaws  like e g  sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too  slow   but i don t mean the scenic parts by that  i totally loved those also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story  like when he is in the underground bunker like thing of digicorps  where all their data is saved  and has this conversation with the guy down there    but that may also just be me  d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized  they should have made the getting back true memory part a bit longer and  louder  but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again',1

'this movie is a gem because it moves with soft  but firm resolution i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there  it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace  it s not about explosions  car chases  or flying bullets  you must be patient and instead  note the details here  it s sedate because that s what the main character is  the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds i will not give spoilers   because that destroys the point of watching  the plot is what you ve read from the other postings  an average white collar guy  seeking change and adventure  signs on for a corporate spy job  just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data take it from there this movie starts at a surreal walk   with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential  underlying suburban paranoia then it begins to accelerate the acting on all parts is superb   and yes  some of the acts are caricature characters  but they all fit  and they entertain  and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft  soft key sinister theme  all is not right at the beginning and at the end  all is not what it seems get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one   and turn up the sound  this movie wants you to listen',1

'this is my first comment  this is a fantastic movie  i watched it all by luck one night on tv  at first   minutes i thought it was a b movie  but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was i suggested to some friends to see the movie  only to tell me that it was a bad b movie  how wrong  superficial critiques i think that the movie is almost a product of genius  the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time',1

'i ve seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot  but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now  and i wan tell it s one the best movies i ve ever seen in my life              what you need to know is that you don t have to miss any minute of this movie  if you don t completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end the end is what makes this movie so good  you can t expect it congratulations to the producer',1

'who can watch a movie  look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed  that woman is amazingly beautiful   a talented actress  that s a tough combination to find now a days  and jeremy northam  i heard his name plenty of times  but i never really noticed him  my advice to hollywood is    use him more  now about the movie  i watched it in one of my graveyard shift  i don t recommend that to anyone  it s a bit to complicated   mysterious for that  i still can t believe i didn t see the ending coming  i m not gonna say what cause that ll spoil the hole movie  although saying this is spoilment enough now i m suppose to cast my vote about this movie  i love the dark mystic story  the actors did a good job   i love the directors  natali  work in the past  there s not a big audience for this kind of thing  that s also pretty risky  you know what  i m just gonna give this work a   cause everybody should see this  then again    point deduction cause there is always space for improvement',1

'wow  one of the greatest movies i have ever   ever seen absolutely loved it  before the opening credits were done i was glued to the screen it s a sci fi thriller   and edge of your seat whodunnit  incredible i wish d it would never end lucy liu is a throwaway role  anyone could have played it  the lead actor  jeremy northram was the perfect geeky guy this movie appeals to me who loved war games  sneakers  and track down incredible          walt d in lv',1

'although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built  or bought  to your specifications  it is not the first  nor the last  in      jack benny and ann sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy george washington slept here by george s  kaufman and moss hart  and about fifteen years ago shelly long and tom hanks had the lead in the money pit  the former was about moving into an   th century country house that   err  needs work  the latter was about building your dream house   in the late     s  although the two films have their moments  both are not as good as blandings  which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name jim blandings and his wife muriel  cary grant and myrna loy  are noticing the tight corners of their apartment  which they share with their two daughters joan and betsy  sharyn moffett and connie marshall   although blandings has a good income as an advertising executive  in      he is making            a year  which was like making            today   and lives in a luxury apartment   which in the new york city of that day he rents    he feels they should seek something better  he and muriel take a drive into the country  connecticut  and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want and they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to  for one thing  they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise  if cynical friend and lawyer bill cole  melvin douglas  in a nicely sardonic role   for example  jim buys land from a connecticut dealer  ian wolfe  sucking his chops quietly   with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of connecticut  bill points out he s paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth  there are problems about water supply that both blandings just never think about  such as hard and soft water   which leads to the zis   zis water softening machine  they find that the designs they have in mind  and have worked out with their architect  reginald denny   can t be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for the escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils jim  he has been appointed to handle the  wham  account   spam  had become a popular result of world war ii  in that the public started using it as a meat substitute  in the light of it s success with the armed forces   jim can t get a grip on this  he s not alone   one or two other executives fumbled it before him   he comes up with the following bit of  poetry      this little piggy went to market he was pink and as pretty as ham he smiled in his tracks as they gave him the ax  he knew he would end up as  wham   his secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of bill to muriel  although  in this case  bill is blameless  but he s always around  jim keeps forgetting that bill is the clearheaded one  and that he s keeping jim and muriel from making so many mistakes   all three have mishaps  the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house  just as the men have left for the day  they can t open the door  and jim  in a panic  tries breaking the door down by a make shift battering ram  he breaks a window  and the door opens by itself the film works quite satisfactorily  with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves  it is one film which  despite changing price levels and salary levels  really does not age at all  after all  most americans dream of owning their own home and always have a number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with myrna loy and emory parnell regarding the paint job parnell s company has to do on the various rooms  she carefully shows the distinct shades of red  blue  etc  she wants   even giving a polite parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue  the commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job  they proudly called loy  mrs  blandings  in the commercials  introduction  you can imagine though how the no nonsense parnell handles the situation afterward  when loy leaves him with his paint crew',1

'this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art  not an entertainment business  lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post war germany utterly captivating  you get absorbed into the dream and you re let go only at the end credits  the plot necessarily comes second  but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised  just wonderful',1

'i m a male  not given to women s movies  but this is really a well done special story  i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job  while deniro is his usual superb self  everything is so well done  acting  directing  visuals  settings  photography  casting  if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love   this is a winner',1

'if you came into the film with expectations  throw them away now  because no amount of hype will do this film justice to categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal  it s a spy thriller  has elements of noir  bits and pieces of action  science fiction  and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative  mind bending plot twists  and gorgeous cinematography a lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative  both in good and bad ways  of other movies  but as they say  every story cribs from shakespeare  so once you can get past that  you re in for a hell of a ride you will need to suspend your disbelief at some points  and while the set never becomes unbelievable  there are portions  read  the elevator  which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals  don t misconstrue that to mean it s on the same level as cheesy sci fi channel movies  though  because this is on a much higher level if you re looking for action  you should turn away  this is pure psychology  but if you re willing to sit down and devote a good    minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience  by all means  do it now  watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it',1

'canadian director vincenzo natali took the art house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube  which is my personal favourite sf film of the   s  it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube  shot entirely on one set  and took this idea in fascinating directions i ve been eagerly awaiting natali s follow up  and although its taken five years for him to mount another project  i m delighted to say it was worth the wait  cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man s place in the world  and how through a completely logical chain of events  finds himself in a situation beyond his control i don t want to reveal too much about the plot  because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down  it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it s head  cypher is such a film morgan sullivan  jeremy northam   one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet  is hired by the company digicorp  they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars  to his bewilderment  they are unbelievably boring  covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese while morgan is waiting for one seminar  he runs into rita foster  an impeccably cast lucy liu   the definition of an ice maiden  she gives him the brush off  but there is something to her he finds irresistible  that s not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in when rita turns up at another one of morgan s seminars  she tells him his life is not what it appears  and i m not saying anything more about the plot  to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us  as well as the tortuous path that s so much fun to follow as with cube  natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people  taking them out of the familiar  and basically seeing what will happen when they re thrust into the unknown  and cypher follows similar patterns  but it s not a carbon copy of cube  it has it s own inspiration cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories  one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge  when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle  it s as much of a shock to us as it is to him one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is  where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns  cypher is also on a low budget  but natali economises it as much as he can  allowing him to broaden the horizon  and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity natali s direction is exceptional  with a deft hand on the reins  there are some amazing camera angles from above  such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast  robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside  all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture  which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film noir the acting is uniformly excellent throughout  jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity  his performance is excellent because it s so modulated  he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes  from a clinical  spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube  he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black  his scene is one of the best because it s an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia  he is a supposed expert in identifying double agents  and it s a fantastic piece of writing  brilliantly acted by hewlett  all he has to do is look at morgan  and we re drawn into his complex mind game but it s lucy liu who s the scene stealer here  too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect  but in cypher  she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove  rita is an aloof  guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish  i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control  and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone things come to a very gratifying end  that doesn t conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did  but morgan deserves his happy ending  after he s been put through the ringer like this  i cheered for him in the final scene  it s a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy    minutes cypher succeeds on all counts  engaging

'director vincenzo natali s cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which  although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration  manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience morgan sullivan  jeremy northam   a stay at home husband with an overbearing wife  decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high tech company digi corp  his job is to travel to conferences across the country  under the assumed identity of jack thursby  and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses  via a nifty little electronic pen gizmo in reality  however  the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities  morgan  along with his fellow conference attendees  is being brainwashed  the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma  during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities  once they are totally convinced that they are someone else  they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies  where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion but digi corp s plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative for hire rita foster  lucy liu   who opens morgan s eyes to what is really happening  she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques  she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby  then he will be  eliminated   morgan plays along  and applies for a job at rival business sunways however  arriving at his new workplace  he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy  fortunately  the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent from hereon in  things get progressively more complicated  the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone  in an exciting finale  all eventually becomes clear  but only if you ve been following events very carefully  director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget  he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast  jeremy northam in particular  is fantastichis portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects  high rise and necropolis',1

'listen  i don t care what anybody says  as cypher is nothing less than a   star movie  cypher is not  i repeat not  a b movie  cypher is an absolute masterpiece  suffice it to say  i am a connoisseur of the world s finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight  i cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is  cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made  the technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime  in fact  i must admit that cypher completely surprised the hell out of me  in fact  i ve recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie  other critics  of whom some downplayed the movie  have no idea as to what the hell they re talking about  don t listen to the haters  and actually  for the most part  reviews of cypher have been largely positive  and it should be noted that cyher is not only a good movie  but it is also a fantastic movie  cypher is the kind of movie that s so advanced and so magnificently crafted  that it s over the heads of most critics and all the cynics  there is nothing wrong with or cheap about cypher whatsoever  again  the cinematography  the backdrops  the technology  the storyline  and the acting are all      world class top notch  naturally  i won t give anything away  this is not a spoiler  and though it is the contention of some critics that cypher should have been in movie theaters  i believe quite the opposite  cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for dvd release only and not in a bad way  cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves  blade runner        brave new world  total recall  logan s run  jason bourne and impostor and deja vu    look out  cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the aonn multimedia research    star eternal spy movie hall of fame  cypher is counterespionage at it s absolute best  hands down and hats off  nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction  the future is now',1

'this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali  the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen  the film is superbly shot  i love the cinematography in this  it feels fresh and original  plot wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall  dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci fi stuff  morgan sullivan  jeremy northam  is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp  a large technological corporation  he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do  it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen  it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife  after his first job things become strange  his habits change  his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares  he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster  played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu   he takes an instant attraction to  however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems  he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp  the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies  sullivan  whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain dead day dream while the speakers drone on  the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages   suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else  digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence  sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby  digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it  they now effectively control what these spies do  except for sullivan  when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp  make sullivan a double agent  they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down  samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system  the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn  he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him  when a mysterious third party becomes involved  the person it is revealed that foster works for  sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent  who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for  the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires  the cast are great  northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent  he brings a great visual aspect to his performance  his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby  lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact  the rest of the cast are also good director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci fi flick cube  has a real visual flair  he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look  for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn t great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively  the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci fi films  it is up there with them  the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this  that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident  the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along  this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states',1

'jeremy northam s characterization of the stuttering  mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu s presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch  his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit  done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face  neck and lips  no matter the brainwashing  love has a way of persevering  love also cannot be  brainwashed in  with either of his two fake wives  in gradual stages  he begins to dispense with his glasses  to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses  the music is fantastic  hypnotic  sexy and appropriately driving at times  the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi  film noir  in the tradition of many classic thrillers  i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu s portrayal  whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states  the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith  some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part  she is just no match for northam s talents  but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author',1

'you ll notice by the stars i ve given this great film that     before you see it the first time   is implied  i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week  and last  was a very slow rental experience  not much great coming in   i m not sure how this movie slipped past me  i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too  still  it did this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don t have a large budget  it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark  just enough  the entire film is you  the viewer  trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns  i would have given this film        however some of the shots were pretty fake looking  i don t hold that against this film too much  but i don t think it deserves a perfect score lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious  as always   i think she s pretty underrated as a serious talent  nevermind her beauty  which is difficult   she really takes her roles seriously and doesn t rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion  and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed  as well jeremy northam does really well  at first  as quite a geeky corporate rat  willing to run through any maze to prove himself  however  as he changes throughout the film  it s like night and day  i know some fans of clive owen  jude law  or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this  but northam would could should fit that bill  he s suave and cultured  he s got a great bond posture and voice  i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it  and rather down to earth  as well great film and definitely this movie buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films',1

'when the matrix appeared in      and questioned existence and identity  it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration  that didn t really happen  surprisingly  and it took till      for a movie of similar theme to appear  but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discredit the story is of a morgan sullivan  who applies for a job with a high flying techno company called digicorp  his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company  while under an assumed and false identity  his home life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he s actually doing  however  things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what s going on  he starts to question who he actually is  this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up   twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated  and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable it s an enthralling journey through a not too distant future  and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat highly recommended',1

'i wasn t sure at first if i was watching a documentary  propaganda film or dramatic presentation  i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable  but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on  we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment where this movie came together for me was closer to the end  the scenes had a realism  at least as i perceived it  that i haven t encountered often before  you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants  this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarce the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in      as the war waged with japan  also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years',1

'the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo  but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far fetched notion the excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill  suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws  the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before the biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation  the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end good movies are not made every year and people don t get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then  apart from the filthy language parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes  the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years',1

'watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early    s  a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as  die hard in a  on a   cliffhanger is  die hard on a mountain   and pretty good  for what it is but unlike passenger    and under siege  which are decent die hard clones on their own terms  cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that  in their immensity  threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations  cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings the opening sequence has already received substantial praise  all of which it deserves  its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening  not even harlin s shot of the falling stuffed animal  which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke  and which he repeated in deep blue sea   or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite s face  can dim the sequence s power the next impressive set piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet  as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin  the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not  the bloody double crosses are completely unexpected  as roger ebert has observed  the stuntman who made the mid air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition later  during the avalanche sequence  one of the terrorists thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain  so far as i know  no one was killed in the making of this movie  a small miracle  considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts   so obviously a dummy was used for the shot  but the shot itself remains impressive because we re left wondering how harlin  or more likely one of the second unit directors  knew exactly where to place the camera i ll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week  because he s one of the few movie stars i ve ever seen who s completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain  and at the same time actually feels that pain  the role of gabe walker really complements stallone s acting strengths  he plays an older  more vulnerable kind of action hero  giving an impressively low key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself in contrast to many of today s post matrix  comic book inspired action heroes  stallone s walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer enhanced abilities  in cliffhanger  the hero almost freezes to death  and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another  he winces when he s hit and bleeds when he s cut  particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky style pummeling from one of the mad dog villains it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie s effectiveness  when i first saw this movie as a teenager  i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust  or rather  the ice   at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise lithgow s british accent is as unconvincing as the movie s occasional model plane or model helicopter  but he s fundamentally a good actor  and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue  in one scene  looking at his hostages stallone and rooker  trying to decide which tasks to give them  he actually says  you  stay  you  fetch   even a better actor  such as anthony hopkins  might have had trouble with that line even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside  it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show early in the movie  for example  lithgow openly says to one of his men  retire  stallone  when he comes down   no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously  his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face  and this precipitates a gripping tug of war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means  but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn t given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or  at times  a western  cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before  the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow  as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action packed narrative  finally  harlin s decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless  since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes it s a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies  because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later  but perhaps it s best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time  without a sequel  there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already  there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit  compared to that clinker  cliffhanger belongs on the imdb s top     list rating     very good  especially considering most of stallone s other movies',1

'sly s best out and out action film  it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters  solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured  stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes  this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the    s  a definite genre classic  as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories  plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form  action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film  the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner  michael rooker and john lithgow',1

'i don t think i ll ever understand the hate for renny harlin   die hard    was cool  and he gave the world  cliffhanger   one of the most awesome action movies ever  that s right  you little punks   cliffhanger  rules  and we all know it sly plays gabe walker  a former rescue climber who is  just visiting  his old town when he is asked to help a former friend  hal tucker  michael rooker   assist in a rescue on a mountain peak  walker obviously came back at a convenient time  because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen  john lithgow   qualen   co  have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u s  government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back   essentially   cliffhanger  is another  die hard  clone  just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains  complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal  naturally  that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough  as stallone s character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease  and slams face first into several rock faces with no apparent side effects  after all  isn t that what action movies are all about  cliffhanger  is one of the most exciting action movies around  a showcase of great scenes and stunts  one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i ve ever seen in a movie  and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning  it maintains its action awesomeness  john lithgow s lead villain is entertaining  and one bad dude  quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever  cliffhanger  is easily one of stallone s best efforts  definitely renny harlin s best effort  and a very exciting action movie',1

'eric valette is obviously a talented film maker  and so are the two guys who wrote the script  therefore malfique is a great flick  made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination  well  i m a bit exaggerating  but nevertheless i m sincere  so  if you like dark  gory movies  go and see this one  it s really worth it',1

'now  i know french inmates are unlikely to have read lovecraft  and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school  maybe as a separate subject   but how did they think something that sounds like  ftagn yog sototh  could possibly lead to any good the movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may  if read right  get them out  as prisons go  the cell was totally unrealistic  so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things  it also moves rather slowly  which may bore people  but other than that  this is top notch horror feeling  mixing sartre s  hell is other people  with a lovecraft barker type of story  and doing rather successfully bottom line  take the time to watch this  that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else  this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it  lessons to be learned  yog is bad  almost as bad as french women',1

'i was hooked from beginning to end  great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump  but to make you go  what the f ck did i just see   all the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about  so i won t rehash what has already been said  i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me  i even had a bad dream after seeing it  and i am a true horror fan  not easily spooked by tripe like  the grudge  or even  silent hill   what gave me the bad dreams was the unease i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys  what would my personal horror be  my subconscious took me there  and it was not pleasant  that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you  the best part of this movie is that it is subtle  it s not about bogeymen that jump out at you alien invasions  or tons of gore  it s the opposite  the horror you create in your own mind  the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it s power over them  simply  the men ask for the one thing they desire  and they get it   but not in the way they imagined  so on the one hand  they get what they wish for from an occult book  but may ultimately wish they hadn t  sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be',1

'now this is what i d call a good horror  with occult supernatural undertones  this nice low budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene  this proves you don t need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie the plot revolves around   cellmates in a prison  and each of these characters  and their motives  become gradually more interesting  as the movie builds up tension to the finale  most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere  who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these   other inmates i won t say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen  there a few flaws though  the fx are not that good  but they re used effectively  the plot leaves some mysteries open  and things get very confusing towards the end  but malefique redeems itself by the time it s over i thought his was a very good movie',1

'french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene  malfique preceded the revival just slightly  but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made  malfique was obviously shot on a low budget  but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film  and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner  the plot focuses on two main ideas  prison and black magic  the central character is a man named carrre  sent to prison for fraud  he is put in a cell with three others  the quietly insane lassalle  body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy  after a short while in the cell together  they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal  after translating part of it  they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls black magic is a very interesting topic  and i m actually quite surprised that there aren t more films based on it as there s so much scope for things to do with it  it s fair to say that malfique makes the best of it s assets as despite it s restraints  the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout  director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film  the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic  and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell   it s very easy to get behind them  it s often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people  and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner  and this helps to ensure that malfique actually does manage to be quite frightening  the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot  the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done  anyone worried that the film won t deliver by the end won t be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying  overall  malfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade   highly recommended viewing',1

'malfique is a very interesting movie  it is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures  the central concept is great  three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth  who the audience identify with  and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell the atmosphere is well woven  it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of edmond dantes  in the chteau d if  prior to becoming the count of monte cristo   the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell  particularly the character we are meant to identify with  carrre   a white collar criminal whose crime is not specified  but it s obliquely suggested might be fraud   on one occasion carrre dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him  we never leave the cell  the claustrophobia is unbroken  there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell  and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall  so even though the film appears to be very modern  it has a very old world feel of incarceration the characters are intriguing  we have marcus  a violent pre op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to pquerette  french for daisy  a heavily retarded young man  pquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful  and unfortunately this included his baby sister  hence his current predicament  i like this comment on internalisation  very primitive   lasalle is a withdrawn  possessed elderly man  in for brutally murdering his wife the central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you  and there s a ritual that goes with that  i think that s what disturbs me the most  seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically  it has a real life ring to it  the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well  every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong  i m actually hearing the gong now every time i do something self destructive i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don t really reinforce the message consistently  particularly with carrre  also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film  not in terms of a successive revelation either  i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish  more by design than execution  such as the famous  vagina eye   and the sodomy of lasalle  for me  totally hollow images at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with  and some things don t seem logical  for example we ve been clumsily led to believe different things about carrre s child  this doesn t change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird  a  pure  horror movie  there is no comedic dross or genre segueing  like cube       natali   the obvious movie to compare it to  it s a total immersion experience  where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters  this last comment i make about it being a  pure  experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when lasalle talks about his past as a librarian  he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him  the books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge  this prompts lasalle to go insane  that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge  it s something i myself have felt one final comment is that two of the quite well received comments on the board have confused the characters  names  to convince yourself that lasalle is the older librarian character  simply click on philippe laudenbach s page and you will see he was born in',1

'i d waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england  but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it  there are a lot of great things to the film  for a start the acting  its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work  this and the constantly gripping and interesting script  with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it  give the film a real solid backbone  add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner  it has my favorite kind of gore too  supernatural and splattery  also  the characters of marcus  the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy  his mentally retarded lover plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times  and give a far out  anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones  this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies  far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce  my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone  but it still works  so on the whole i d really recommend this to serious horror buffs',1

'malfique  is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well executed plot and a lot of heart  its cast doesn t have recognized names  it doesn t have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect  but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well written script  an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills  eric valette may not be a well know name yet  but with  malfique   his feature length debut  he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet  gans or aja the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell  four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal  to get out  carrre  grald laroche  gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi millionaire fraud  his cell mates  the violent marcus  clovis cornillac   the intellectual lassalle  philippe laudenbach  and the mentally challenged pquerette  dimitri rataud   are all convicted for murder and give carrre a cold welcome  their personalities will clash as carrre discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier   malfique  is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barker s stories  the movie s strongest point is the way it builds up the characters  they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities  the story s supernatural element is very well handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel  despite being a movie about four men locked in a room  the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact  the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust  claustrophobia  and specially  paranoia director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere  mood and his cast to give life to the plot  despite its obvious lack of budget  he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original  fresh and very attractive  his subtle and effective camera work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location  and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot  the very few displays of special effects are very well done and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore the characters are what make this film work  and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit  grald laroche is excellent as carrre  a man at first sight innocent  but who hides a dark past  philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too  specially rataud in his very demanding role  however  is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus  a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself  the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them the movie is terrific  but it is not without its share of flaws  of course  the most notorious one is its the low budget  some of the cgi effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make up and prosthetics used in other scenes  however  it is never too bad for it  probably the bad thing about  malfique  is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters  not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view anyways   malfique  is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately  and one that deserves to have more recognition  valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest  albeit complex  tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities  personally  this film is a new favorite',1

'i wasn t born until   years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid    s and the rest is history      i was hooked  the premise was pretty simple  two hardened nemesis agents  richard barrett and craig stirling   william gaunt and stuart damon  are partnered up with an expert  if not young  doctor and biologist  sharron macready  to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china  whilst making their escape  their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio  thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come   the series lasted for    hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived  one season run that has set it up for cult status monty berman  the producer  was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets   particularly in episodes such as  happening    a studio deputising for the australian outback  and the  snow  sets of  operation deep freeze  and  the beginning  but if you can get past this  and focus on the characters and the story lines  the show was really a lot of fun  it had a great mix of adventure  and plenty of deadpan humour  mainly from some terrific one liners from william gaunt  the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic   you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the      reunion documentary where the three reunite after over    years to reminisce about the show  and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig     they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine  i have to say  i was always a richard barrett fan   i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge   he was certainly a man you didn t cross  and those eyes        the bluest eyes you would probably see on tv  i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since  however  craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with  including donald sutherland  jeremy brett  peter wyngarde  burt kwouk  anton rodgers  kate o mara  jenny linden  paul eddington and colin blakely notable episodes for me were    auto kill    the interrogation    the fanatics    the mission  and  the gilded cage  but i am sure every one has their personal favourites if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time  or to re watch it after many years  remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy   the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don t think i will ever tire of it enjoy',1

'well  what can i say  other than these people are super in every way  i quite like sharon mcreedy  i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of   discs    episodes  i did not realise that they had made so many  i also think that it is a great shame  that they have not made any more  i wish that i got given these powers  imagine me  being knocked off my cycle  somewhere and being knocked out cold  then waking up in a special hospital  later on  i discover that my body has been enhanced  just like richard barrat  these stories are    minutes of pure action and suspense all the way  you cannot fight these   people  as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry  the music is well written  and to me  puts a wonderful picture of   super beings in my mind  the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats  improved sight  improved hearing and touch  and the strength of    men for richard and craig and the strength of   women for sharon  who i thought was beautiful and intelligent  when i was a boy  i had a huge crush on her     now i can see why  on my dvd set  the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series  i also thought that trymane was a good boss  firm but he got things done',1

'monty berman and dennis spooner followed up  the baron  with this  a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted  the six million dollar man   it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster  and i enjoy watching it still  stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable on screen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett  while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready  the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne  by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson  terry nation and brian clemens  while spooner s own  the interrogation  compared favourably with  the prisoner   i regret that there was never a second series  the concept had so much life left in it  would craig and richard have been competitors for sharron s affections  what if tremayne had learned of the champions  powers  did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw  we never found out  alas',1

'i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy i have ever seen  it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation  the thought that maybe they won t get together    it is an indie film after all  this movie was well written  directed and acted  the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent',1

'the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly s  i ll take you there  is not overt  but clearly has ties to his work  shelly has acted in two of hartley s films   not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative  but the hyper stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light  though this film is not ironic on the whole  thank god   the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss  with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies   i ll see you there  is a great indie film that doesn t stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion the film begins with bill s life falling to pieces  not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home  but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat  all washed up  bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy  played by the director adrienne shelly  brings him all kinds of surprises  a self help book and a  date  for her traumatized brother the unwilling bill tries to refuse  but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice  no doubt bernice s initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to  rebound  with her  however  her pseudo hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date  and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him  forcing herself upon him  to what end  we are not aware    except for maybe the fact that she is psycho   and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy  aware that bill desperately wants to see rose  bernice offers her car  but on the condition that he take her somewhere first  on the way  she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun  a pinkerton detective  no less   an imbroglio of angst  resentment  redemption  passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose    of course  with a few stops along the way',1

'manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences  the worst one is the lack of closet space  some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full melvin frank and norman panama  a great comedy writing team from that era  saw the potential in eric hodgins novel  whose hero  jim blandings  can t stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife muriel  and two daughters  must share jim blandings  a madison ave  executive  has had it  when he sees an ad for connecticut living  he decides to take a look  obviously  a first time owner  jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent  this is only the beginning of his problems whatever could be wrong  goes wrong  the architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn t work for the new house  after the original one is razed  as one problem leads to another  more money is necessary  and whatever was going to be the original cost  ends up in an inflated price that jim could not really afford the film is fun because of the three principals in it  cary grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of jim blandings  myrna loy  was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite mr  grant  the third character  bill cole  an old boyfriend of myrna  turned lawyer for the blandings  is suave and debonair  the way melvin douglas portrayed him  one of the blandings girls  joan  is played by sharyn moffett  who bore an uncanny resemblance to eva marie saint  the great louise beavers plays gussie  but doesn t have much to do the film is lovingly photographed by james wong howe  who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better  the direction of h c  potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies',1

'this movie is wonderful  the writing  directing  acting all are fantastic  very witty and clever script  quality performances by actors  ally sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky  really original and heart warmingly unpredicatable  the scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production',1

'i too have gone thru very painful personal loss  twice  and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well  life out of balance  nothing makes sense  well meaning relatives  etc   it was nice to see ally again  she is one of my all time favorite movie actors i laughed and cried as the story unfolded  great story and cast  well done',1

'i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne s  waitress          this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie  adrienne was a marvelously talented writer director  an original and unique artist  she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency  ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge  male lead reg rodgers  looking like judd nelson  is fine  there is also a great cameo by ben vereen  the song at the end of the movie  the bastard song  written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy  it s a world of suffering in a sea of pain no matter how much sun you bring you re pummeled by the rain   don t let the heartless get you down don t greet the heartless at your door don t live among the heartless',1

'this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail  there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven t come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one  this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film  at first  the action seems rather off the wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves  even if grudgingly  through each other  rogers  heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedy s angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them  you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it s in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread  hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt',1

'for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actors had headed south of the border and  i guessed  all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comedies this film was a real surprise  despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces  the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we  the viewer  got back was almost true suspension of belief  when the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police  you almost believed it was possible if you are a fan of some of the better sex farces  canadian or not  you should definitely seek this one out  and the big surprise  this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity',1

'aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie  i think i ve watched every movie guy ritchie has directed  twice  needless to say  i m a big fan and revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why  this movie is a very different approach from ritchie  when you look at it comparatively with lock  stock    and snatch  revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didn t expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn t know he needed  along with seeing andr benjamin of outkast fame strut his acting ability  other standout acts are ray liotta playing the maniacal mr  d macha and mark strong playing sorter  the hit man after being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner  macha  jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent  when he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from macha  jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that s left him with three days to live  a team of loan sharks  however  have an answer for him and a ticket to life  only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them  all in a ploy to both take macha down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself  along with having the air of death loom  and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money  jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him  which introduces sorter   a hit man under macha s employ  the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co  convicts he spent time with in solitary may very well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into  when faced with this reality though  zack  vincent pastore  and avi show jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary  having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to jake  the movie unravels to a humbling process for both jake and macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons the style of the movie is top notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes  although a lot of nods at ritchie s previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue  the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre  it s also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should  the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and  true to ritchie fashion  they re all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone s affairs  i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i don t want to take too much away from it if you haven t seen it yet it may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it s a great movie and it should be seen  if you re lucky and you haven t seen the watered down us release  see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take  i saw it with my crew around early      and we re still talking about it with little things we ve picked up on today  it has garnered its cult status  and it s well  deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit standout line   fear or revere me  but please  think i m special  we share an addiction  we re approval junkies',1

'ah ritchie s made another gangster film with statham  thought the average fan  expecting another snatch lock stock  expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts  but none too hard for  me and the lads  to swallow after a few beers ah  pay attention  you do need to watch this film  no cups of tea  no extra diet cokes from the counter  no  keep it running  shouts as you nip to the fridge   watch the film  no laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence  and if that floats your boat  so be it  but sharp solid direction  excellent dialogue  and great performances my favourite   big pussy from the sopranos  always a reliable hood',1

'if you are a fan of altman s large ensemble casts  as evidenced in major films like m a s h   nashville  gosford park  and lesser seen films like a wedding  then you will no doubt be entertained by health  centered around a health convention where two women are running for president  health contains many of altman s latter   s regulars like paul dooley  who helped write the film   carol burnett  and henry gibson  while also including top star altman newcomers like lauren bacall  james garner  and glenda jackson  like a lot of altman ensemble films there are numerous subplots in this film  but it is not nearly as overwhelming as films like nashville or a wedding  rather it has a more centered feel  perhaps like m a s h  or gosford park  the whole thing is an obvious satire on the health movement  filled with over top  outlandish  contradictive characters  with guest stars like dick cavett providing a wry commentary on the whole thing  underlining the whole election process is altman s characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having  this would be one of altman s last films like this for a while',1

'i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art  i was very surprised to see the overall rating as     not only does guy bring together a b list ish  movie cast and make them into such glorious characters  he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate   yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable this film is special  get it  now',1

'i m giving ten out of ten it s one of the best movies ever  absolutely smashed  stunned and dazed by the whole picture  marvellous playing of jason statham  ray liotta and all the crew  amazing plot    just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit it touched your soul  because it s strange  but there are all the answers you ve been ever looking for    the very best  mr  ritchie  the very best ever  those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed  but there are lots of shallow movies in hollywood nowadays  you can t remember what it was about the next day you had seen it  on the contrary  revolver is unique  i could have hardly expected it s possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself  of everyone who was to watch it  absolutely unsurpassed  astounding  dazzling    one can get insight watching this  i have no doubt about that  actually  no words can express my admiration    i m still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy hollywood rubbish we had been watching  thank you from all heart  it s simply the best',1

'it s all very simple  jake goes to prison  and spends five years with the con and the chess masters  they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure  and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks  they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom  from his innermost fears  from what he believes to be himself  for that  they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear  all the pride  all the hope   to be reborn as true master of his will it s a clever movie about the journey of illumination  about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves         no doubt',1

'i have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life  believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all time classic  i was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both lock  stock     and snatch  but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed  i absolutely loved this film and i can t wait to see it again  this film is totally different to both of the aforementioned ritchie films  and also a lot better  i have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie  i believe he has taken movie making to another level   i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film  but i believe time will prove me right    this movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the  hr or so running time as i couldn t stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together  i have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film   some answers from endless hours of thinking  some answers from reading other people s take on the film  and now cannot wait until sunday when i will see it again  i just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been',1

'having read the reviews for this film  i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good  however  this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time  the majority of reviews that i had read  said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow  and whilst some parts do leave you confused  the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you ve missed so much  it s not like  lock  stock     or  snatch   in the sense that it isn t that funny  in fact  it s pretty dark   and it is a lot more intelligent  in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints  and  in one of the best scenes of the film  jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself   the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned  is that it is full of memorable characters  specifically statham  who gives a fantastic performance as the lead  and ray liotta  who spends most of the film in speedos  but gives a great performance none the less  if you ve got time  and have time afterwards to think about the film  and even watch it again  you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film  i think it s fantastic  and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game',1

'i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone  the fact is it wasn t what anyone was expecting  especially from guy ritchie  what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners  do ya like dags   etc  but this is far more mature than his previous works  i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder  this film demands all your attention  look past the cool and dazzling look of the film  try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film yes this has its influences from modern classics  fight club  pulp fiction etc   but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none  i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney  masterpieces',1

'first of all  don t go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock  this is a different sort of gangster film i saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience  it s the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that  that was awful  and the other half will leave thinking what was that  that was cool  personally i like films that i don t understand  i e mullholland drive  and usual suspects  so i enjoyed revolver it definitely wasn t perfect though  i saw the big twist coming a mile away  at least part of it  and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good  revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed  also some scenes  like the animation  and the scene where sorter goes on a killing spree actually one of my favourites   although  awesome scenes to watch  seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch  not because they fit in with the movie however there were many good things too  i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors  jason stratham  ray liotta  vincent pastore  and even andre benjamin who was a pleasant surprise   this movie definitely kept my interest  with one great  suspenseful  action packed  scene after another  when ray liotta was being held under the table wow    well you have to see it  the script was extremely well done  and the soundtrack  as with most guy ritchie films  was great though a step below such movies as fight club  mullholland drive  and usual suspects  it was still an awesome fast paced  psychological  action movie  with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over',1

'i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away  it is a real masterpiece of art and i don t understand why most of the people think it s garbage  the main idea of the movie   take your ego away and then you will have true power  this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way   the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look    do you remember this from the movie  because our true enemy is in us   it is our ego    that voice that always tells us that we are important  that gives us our pride  that tells us not to give  but only to take  that creates our aggression  that wants to be in control  that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts  gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance  a superb movie',1

'i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think  and don t just drip feed the answers to their audience   revolver  is one of these films  and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow  with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it  first time  true  it doesn t compare to other mind mucks like  the usual suspects  or  memento   but in its own right its an intelligent and thought provoking film another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is  every scene  every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages  if you see it you ll know what i mean so  to conclude    watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it  if not  well  no one ever said  revolver  is for everyone  and that s my   cents',1

'in the classic sense of the four humors  which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment   altman s  h e a l t h   treats all of the humors  and actually in very funny  entertaining ways  there s the phlegm  as personified by lauren bacall s very slow  guarded  and protective character esther brill  who s mission in life appears to be all about appearance  protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well being  there s paul dooley s choleric dr  gil gainey  who like a fish out of water  perhaps more like a seal  flops around frenetically  barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness  the melancholy of glenda jackson s isabella garnell smacks of shakespeare s troubled and self righteous hamlet    even proffering a soliloquy or two  and let s not forget henry gibson s bile character  bobby hammer   the breast that feeds the baby rules the world    then there s the characters harry wolff and gloria burbank  james garner and carol burnett  respectively   relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for h e a l t h     a kind of world trade organization specializing in h e a l t h   which is to say anything but health  this is altman at his classic best',1

'first of all  when people hear  guy ritchie   they immediately think of snatch  yes  snatch was a good movie  but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch  they don t expect him to explore new frontiers  this movie revolver is different than snatch  it s much darker and is very complex  the reason i gave a rating of    is because i ve had to watch revolver   times to understand everything  so this movie toys with your head  it s very cleverly written this movie is different than snatch  it was done wonderfully  the cinematography is beautiful  and you can recognize guy ritchie s personal touch  style of directing  in it what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers',1

'ok    this movie so far has been slated by critics and board posters alike  although playing devil s advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn t make it for themselves as film makers  and board posters are often people who didn t make it for themselves as critics  so i wanted to sit in guy s corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who ve decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it the film s biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is  this has been described many times as as making the film  inaccessible  to the viewer  the film s chronology is relatively non linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle  or not so subtle  hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory  ie  ray liotta s character brandishing a gun saying the words  fear me  is portrayed as both tragically pathetic  from statham s pov  or interrogating and bold  from liotta s pov   this is but one example of ritchie s far more mature approach he has taken to film making with revolver  we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal  the strong but silent gritty anti hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption    i mean it s paint by numbers film noir here guys  all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice overs  but then guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points take the scene where jason statham s character runs afoul of a car  this throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever    but ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death so the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling  i d be taking the p ss if i said i didn t spend the last    minutes or so of the film turning to my date going  uh    wtf      but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art  it is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand  and even easier to say  well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film    in my humble opinion  revolver is a stylish  complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the saatchi brothers  if we choose this opportunity to collectively say  ah sh t  i wanted a film about a load of bleeding  cockney gangsters in nit loll    guy ritchie is a tit   then the day will come when film makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow  crappy people  just because guy made a name for himself with funny  cheeky cockney romps  doesn t mean he can t be deep without being  pretentious   funny people can be thoughtful too',1

'i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid  and  naturally  was moved to tears by this story of a fox family  the fantastic scenery at hokkaid  the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists  i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack  to german viewers it might be useful to know that the defa dubbing is the only one worth listening to  i taped both  defa and br  but i keep viewing the first one only',1

'glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made the film makes you care about each member of this fox family  from the blind cub to the strongest   their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic  set against an inhospitable countryside  the audience s hearts warm to the family members the music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms man remains one of the biggest predators  but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living  not just surviving beyond human endeavours',1

'i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old   i bugged my parents to take me back three times  i began looking for it on video about five years ago  finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site  but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased  i understand the original video run was small   or have the rights purchased by the family channel  disney  etc  and shown regularly  it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan  narrated by a wise old tree  the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well  it would be a good seller today  better than many of the weak offerings to children s movies today',1

'i recommend families if possible to show this to older children only some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle now that thats out of the way let me explain about this movie this is in reality a documentary of a male fox who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score is breath taking you had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible it ll get ugly later they gave both the fox and the vixen names but i can t remember what they are for the likes of me he fights off this invading male to win her love they later on create a den and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs one of which is blind there are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon the first victim is the blind pup who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away the second victim is the mother who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole she unknowingly walks into a foot trap while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot causing her to bleed to death the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree the male is now a single dad forced to take on the roll of mom and dad he alone has to teach them the skills they need for life it later proves not to be enough when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own  thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man i won t spoil the surprising ending for you but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through i wanted to say that i saw this when it first came out in early     s  when we had a thing called showbiz cable i was only   when i saw it but i could never understand why they wouldn t let me see all of it now i know why after i secretly watched it when it came on disney when i was   i felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on i was moved to tears but as dark and ugly as it was it serves a purpose to let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals and why they are endangered this documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species and i hoped it worked its not fake like the true life nature films by disney they don t teach about why animals are going extinct the encroachment of land the killing off of the foxes main prey and senseless killing of these beautiful animals has resulted in them becoming endangered i wish they would make sequel to this movie  glacier fox      to see if they re being treated better maybe have it be about a vixen pup named teresa and her siblings growing up this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes especially when one of the parents suddenly dies the surviving parent takes on the roll of both and tries to teach the important lessons of life it isn t always enough to protect them when they re adults especially when some of their lives becomes ruined or they fall victims to tragedy themselves best all around soundtrack and musical score i ve ever heard',1

'pick up never got the respect it should have  it works on many levels  and has a complicated but followable plot  the actors involved give some of their finest performances  ann margret  roy scheider  and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals  notable too are vanity  who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows  and kelly preston  who s character will haunt you for a few days  anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this',1

'this is a great  small  film  i say  small  because it doesn t have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions  as in a john woo film  great performances by roy scheider and the three  bad guys   john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days  the film is very easy to watch  the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine  instead of everything going around and around  it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens  wonderful ending  very positive  i never read the elmore leonard book  but it can t be much different from the film because it feels like i m watching an elmore leonard movie',1

'this slick and gritty film consistently delivers  it s one of frankenheimer s best and most underrated films and it s easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date  and if you are scratching your head thinking  but i loved get shorty  you need to be punched in the face   in my opinion  no one captures the  feel  for leonard s characters better then john glover in    pick up  the relocation of the story from detroit  novel  to hollywood  film  elevates the story s sleaze factor to amazing heights  be a man  have a few beers and watch this movie  for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are  swag  rum punch  cat chaser  city primeval  and    pick up  my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate  i also have a real special place in my cold  movie heart for dead bang and black sunday',1

'spoilers from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the       news  i wanted to see it  i don t remember who it was  or which local omaha newscast carried the review  but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church going nebraskan  they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann margret when she s swimming in the pool  glover s character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth  using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out  i was hooked  there was one problem  though  i was only    years old at the time  and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable  let s just say  it was worth the wait if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine  this movie is it  to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement  the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman  roy scheider  who is as effective as ever  plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains  john glover s character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time  he s sleazy  funny at times  and always on the brink of doing something crazy  then there s robert trebor s  nice name  by the way   character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme  he is a whimpering  sweating  coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models  then  you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy  a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason  who could forget the wake up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear after dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he s up against  scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation  that is until glover goes after his wife  the conflict is played out brutally  with virtually the entire cast getting shot  raped  or blown up i don t know why i love this movie so much  it really should creep me out  but it doesn t  maybe it s because these characters are all interesting  and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try  it s scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glover s running around out in l a  looking for trouble  just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle   hey sport  have a nice day  this film has plenty of shootouts  cool cars  great dialog  like the line in my opening statement   and decent acting  plenty of cameos by real life porno stars  look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glover s place another thing i must add  how hot are the women in this film    wow  travolta did right by marrying kelly preston  yum  we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian  and ann margret  what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty   of    stars so sayeth the hound added feb           rip roy scheider',1

'chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos  unfaltering performances  rock solid writing  and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever all of the cast are strong  but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy s  anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes  particularly from the first few seasons  james gandolfini is absolutely fierce  absolutely terrifying  and you still find yourself loving him   mesmerized by him many people that i ve spoken to about the sopranos  who haven t seen it yet  will say  i m just not a fan of mafia movies shows   whatever  run   don t walk   and get it  those same people usually love  e r    but i bet they don t much care for hospitals    it s not about the context',1

'now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i m appalled  for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i m afraid i don t know what the world has come to  let me tell u something  i started watching many t v shows like lost  prison break  dexter  deadwood and even invasion  but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season  especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took   genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season  then we have the sopranos  i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season  and more importantly all of its episodes  there is no department that this show doesn t excel in  acting  nothing short of superb  james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode  after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would ve been the better choice  however after watching the first few episodes  i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony  the raw emotion he displays is superb  then we have everyone else  edie falco  michael imperioli  lorraine bracco  dominic chianese  whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part    and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie  walnuts  gualtieri and silvio dante  all of these actors perform to the best quality  and all giving an excellent performance in each episode  then we have the story  never have i been so sucked into a t v show before  the story is nothing short of excellent  each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic  i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of  its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence  but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television  and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show  not just say its too violent  or they feel that the character of tony is immoral  i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day  i don t think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god  i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me  you ll be hooked from the very first episode  i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show  hooked on it  trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t v  after you ve watched the first season  you ll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television  and no t v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos',1

'as the godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite  this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man s point of view  if you ve never watched this show  you re in for an extended treat  yes  there is violence and nudity  but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast tony soprano  the thinking man s gangster  with the reality of the life he has been born to and  quite frankly  would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up  tony soprano can discuss sun tzu with his therapist  then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage  and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew  take a break  sit down and watch tv while eating peanut butter out of the jar  and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a sunday afternoon of viewing nfl football  even carmella  his wife  when given a chance for a way out  finds that she really prefers life with tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own  if you followed the whole thing  you know how it ends  if you didn t  trust me you ve never seen a tv show end like this',1

'the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever  so naturally my expectations were through the roof  and yet the show surpassed them  i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds  but this is so much more      hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia action stories  but also to be a great family drama  a shocking character study  a laugh out loud comedy  a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil  and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one  david chase s epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more  and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection  paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away realism is present when it is needed  but chase s decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for  dream episodes  and the like only adds more layers to the series  chase  along with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter  future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectively  turns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i ve seen on tv james gandolfini domineers the show as tony  one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever  tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture  but he defies the other half entirely  and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr  melfi  lorraine bracco  with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show   we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect edie falco matches the power of gandolfini s performance as tony s wife carmela  from her mixed feelings about tony s lifestyle  to her suspicions about murders  to her torment over tony s cheating  to her own thoughts about infidelity  carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout   seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non  mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world  scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television the supporting cast is almost as phenomenal  and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons  somehow without any redundancies  nancy marchand steals the show as tony s overbearing mother livia  an insight into tony s personality problems and panic attacks  the familiarity of marchand s incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far  michael imperioli is christopher  tony s protg  whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed  drea de matteo plays christopher s girlfriend adriana  and is so well  meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christopher s career  tony sirico is paulie  introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic  but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show  and nobody plays true anger better than he  and that s just the tip of the iceberg familiar faces such as peter bogdanovich  jon favreau  ben kingsley  lauren bacall  will arnett  nancy sinatra  david strathairn  robert patrick  hal holbrook  burt young  and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show  while names as notable as joe pantoliano  steve buscemi  and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series  there are     great characters with powerful arcs  and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series  which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough  the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered  the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall  and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows  most of which i disagree with  whether you love or hate the ending  or what you make of it is irrelevant  the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself  the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history  there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show  so if you re thinking of watching something else instead  do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit',1

'the sopranos  now preparing to end  is the very peak of adult television and drama  when the sopranos hits the mark  it really hits the mark  using great writing and great actors  most of them being extras from goodfellas  the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way  heading up the cast is james gandolfini  who for all intensive purposes is tony soprano  and edie falco  who certainly holds her own  the series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary  usually violence and foul language   tony sirico  michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting  seasonal extras are also worth note including names like steve buscemi  great    joe pantoliano  great    david proval  good   robert patrick  robert loggia and frank vincent the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique tv  symbolism and simple story lines  dreams and shoot outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect hbo package  watch it',1

'the sopranos stands out as an airtight  dynamic exploration of american life  and how the american experience is shaped and defined by money  by setting the story in the milieu of the underworld  david chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt  low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post modern era every character represents a facet of american industry  tony soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff  torn between familial duty and a need to keep his  business  on an even keel  the convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward  the characters of christopher  paulie  and bobby reflect the loyal   but self serving underlings present in every enterprise  who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit  with the character of ralph  joe pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath  a twisted businessman who s flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power  and dominic chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old guard  which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up  and comers to deflect blame though abrasive and occasionally disturbing  the sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate tv drama ps a good companion piece to chase s series would be the shield  another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting',1

'the sopranos is perhaps the most mind opening series you could possibly ever want to watch  it s smart  it s quirky  it s funny   and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can t resist watching  the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters  set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families  for most of the time  you really don t know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back  or buy them lunch further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities   these are dangerous men  most of them murderers  but by god if you don t love them too  i ve laughed at their wisecracks  been torn when they ve made err in judgement  and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show s subtext   people aren t always as they seem  and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds if you haven t already  you most definitely should',1

'i ve only watched the first series on dvd  but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino like script  the series is as good as goodfellas and casino  and almost as good as the godfather  hence not a        and far better than any of guy ritchie s efforts  although there s plenty of action  some of it pretty bloody  the story is character driven  even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines  e g  the priest s relationship  or lack of  with carmilla and the restaurateur s wife  and christopher and his dimwit friend  who didn t last very long  a darwin award nominee   apart from the plot  the script and the acting  the other reasons i liked it    it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce     the music     it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems',1

'it probably isn t fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten  but oh well       from a standpoint of acting  how could any actor fail with these characters  each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life  tony soprano while a mob  capo  and suffering from mental illness  still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive  each of his men  you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism  it definitely brings out a sort  nosey  side in each and every viewer  and i include myself in this while some above don t care for bracco  i have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since good fellas  she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason  that makes him decent  that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long  if ever  she is simply put  his savior   not speaking in religious tones but the knockout performance here is without doubt  edie falco  to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series   oz  and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress  she has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress  something only actresses like merle streep can get away with  a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles  but as i have mentioned before  with a characters a strong as these  how can any actor fail livia s strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself  she is a survivor  as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors  she is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband s business  yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey  she is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then tony himself all in all  the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january      to see the next season  this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series  it was what brought the larry sanders show  sex and the city  dream on  and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them  too much space in between seasons and very sporadic  until then  i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled',1

'i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it  i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released  in all    episodes so far  the best one is definitely episode     denial  anger  acceptance  this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos  his name was brendan filone  he was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver  brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang  in the end  he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath  and that s my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos  brendan filone is     for me  and my     most favorite character ever was matthew bevilaqua  who was killed after attempting to murder christopher moltisanti  tony and pussy shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him  my     most favorite character is sean gismonte  who was killed right after shooting christopher  and finally  my     most favorite character is chucky signore  one of uncle junior s henchmen  he was killed on a boat by tony  all the awesome characters are dead  that s the only bad thing about the sopranos  all the cool guys always get killed  you know what would be great to change about the sopranos  they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris  tony  uncle junior  silvio  and paulie  because they need to get their revenge  brendan filone shall strike back',1
